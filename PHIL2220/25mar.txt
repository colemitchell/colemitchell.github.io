Compatibilist
 - watered-down determinism "doctrine of necessity"
 - watered-down free will "doctrine of liberty"
    - Not freedom from necessity, but freedom from compulsion/constraint.
         - What takes away free will is being in chains, paralyzed, with a gun to your head, drugged, etc.
         - As long as you're able to act according to your own wishes, then you're free and it doesn't really matter whether your entire psychology was determined by nature.
    - Yes, free will requires the ability to do otherwise, in a certain sense. But not the ability to do otherwise period.
    - But what it requires is the ability to do otherwise if you so choose.
    - e.g. If I choose to raise my arm, it raises. If I choose to lower my arm, it lowers. My choices result in actions. There isn't anything interfering, so I'm free.
    - Compatibilists often say this is all that matters in the real world of courtrooms and moral responsibility.

Turning the tables
 - People often worry that determinism destroys morality and religion. (cf. Kant coming up)
    - They say it takes away free will, which means there's no moral responsibility and the Last Judgment makes no sense.
 - Hume says quite the contrary, it's indeterminism that has dangerous consequences.
    - Moral responsibility for an action only makes sense when the action results from the agent's character/personality.
    - If the action is completely random, a matter of chance, then it makes no sense to hold the agent responsible for it.
    - So indeterminism destroys moral responsibility.
 - Objection: But doesn't determinism mean our actions trace back to God? So either all sins are excused, or else God is guilty of our sins.
    - Reply: All sins are excused? No, we'll still blame each other for killing, lying, stealing, etc. no matter what big picture reasoning tells us.
             God is guilty of our sins? Well, that's a tough one, too tough for me to solve!



Metaphysics:

 modest / limited / down-to-earth
 foundations for natural science: e.g., space/time, cause/effect, substance/accident, necessity/contingency
   - We can achieve (objective/rational) synthetic a priori knowledge here. But it's restricted to appearances, objects of possible experience.
        - Thanks, Hume, but you're wrong.
   - sensibility (passive/given/intuitions), understanding (active/thought/concepts)
       - forms of intuition, forms of thought

 extreme / extravagant / sublime
 Wolffian special metaphysics: e.g., immortality, freedom, God
 'problems of pure reason'
   - No such luck here.
   - But we cannot avoid this. There is a natural predisposition in human reason. A need to these questions.
   - We can refute all speculative proofs and disproofs, and protect traditional doctrines (escape from contradiction) by distinguishing APPs from TIIs.
        - Sorry, Descartes and Leibniz and Wolff and Mendelssohn (dogmatic uncritical metaphysicians). Sorry, Spinoza and dogmatic uncritical freethinkers.
   - We can provide practical 'proofs' (faith).
