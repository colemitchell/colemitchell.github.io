<span class="epagno"></span> 

To the Right Reverend Father in God, 

BENJAMIN, 

Lord Bishop of <em>Winchester</em>, 

AND 

Prelate of the Most Noble 

Order of the Garter. 

<strong>My Lord,</strong> 

<div class="unindented numbered">
<span class="dropcap"><span>A</span></span> Dedication penned after the usual Forms, and prefixed to a Book of severe Morality, would be no less indecent and absurd in it self, than offensive to your Lordship, and disagreeable to the Author.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">Author. [<strong>And</strong>] | <strong>And</strong></span></span>
<strong>And</strong> yet I mean not by this Concession to preclude my self from saying what I apprehend ought to be said<span class="punct2">;</span> much less to prejudice you against hearing what may seem fit to be heard. For tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> wise Men have been justly disgusted at the Addresses, so frequently and indiscriminately offered by modern Dedicators<span class="punct2">;</span> yet surely there may be, on the other hand, too great a Delicacy<span class="punct">;</span> and the nicest Palates may sometimes submit to receive what they cannot perhaps rightly relish<span class="punct2">;</span> especially when the Interest of the Publick requires it to be set before them. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Notwithstanding</strong> my particular Obligations to your Lordship, which I gladly take this Opportunity of acknowledging, you might possibly have escaped this Trouble, could I any where have found, in a higher Degree, that Disposition of Mind which I most covet in a Patron. I mean, my Lord, the <em>Love of Truth</em> for Truth<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s sake<span class="punct2">;</span> a Quality not only less common, but, as it happens, less invidious than any that <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">that [I] | I</span></span> I know of. A man may be allowed either to praise it in others, or pretend to it himself, without much Offence. And I must confess I shall never want Inclination for the one, or Ambition for the other. Permit me to add, that it appears peculiarly suitable to the Subject: and Strain of my Book<span class="punct2">;</span> which to Minds of a different Cast, may easily seem the Work of an Enthusiast, or the Dreams of a Visionary. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>As</strong> I apprehend, the chief Marks and fruits of this generous Affection are a <em>single Eye</em>, and a stedfast Heart<span class="punct2">;</span> the one undistorted, and the other unperverted<span class="punct2">;</span> a Mind divested, as far as Humanity will allow, of all Prejudices, and inflexibly attentive to Evidence alone<span class="punct2">;</span> neither sway<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d by Favour, nor aw<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d by Displeasure, nor seduced by Interest, nor blinded by Passion; a Pursuit after Truth, active and unwearied, according to its Moment; and a Defence of it, resolute and zealous, in the same Proportion a fixed Purpose of <em>seeking</em> some Truths as <em>Silver</em> and searching for them <em>as for <nobr>hid</em><span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>hid</em> [<em>Treasure</em>;] | <em>Treasure</em>;</span></span> <em>Treasure</em>;</nobr> and when sound, of guarding them as sacred, on all Occasions, under all Events, and against the strongest Tide of Opposition. If there be any Man, my Lord, who bears these illustrious Marks, in a Manner and Measure superior to yours; I promise to ask his Leave, and press for his Consent, that I may prefix his Name to my Book, and blot out your Lordship<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Whatever</strong> Questions may have formerly arisen concerning the <em>Circumstantials</em> of Religion; your Concern and Zeal for its <em>Essentials</em> have been at all Times unquestionable. And had I said most conspicuous, and exemplary, I could have found as many Vouchers, as there are Men to whom your Lordship is well known. Well known, did I say? He must be an utter Stranger to you, who is not sensible of it; and more than a Stranger, who seeing it, is not ready to attest it. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I am here speaking not only of Natural, but Revealed Religion; not only of the Doctrines of Morality, but of those <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">those [of] | of</span></span> of Christianity; which you have guarded with equal Fidelity, Vigilance, and Success. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> your Labours have not been confined to Fundamentals; yet there they have Centered. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> you have been far from overlooking the Convenience, Beauty, and Grandeur of the Fabrick, yet your Eye has ever been intently fixed on the Security of its Foundations. And it is greatly to be wished, that more Eyes, and more Hands had been constantly employed the same way. For too evident it is, that whatever Care has been taken of the Structure, and of the Decencies and Decorations thereof, the Ground-work has been long and notoriously neglected. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>To</strong> me, my Lord, it seems an incontestable Truth, that whoever maintains the Reality and Dignity of Revelation at the Expence either of Natural Religion, or of Morality, highly injures and weakens all Three.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Should any Architect, or Workman, dig out large Stones from the Foundation of a Building, in order to be wrought up <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">up [and] | and</span></span> and fitted into a Coine, or a Cornice, I need not ask what would be said, or thought, of such Management. And yet wherein does it differ from the Conduct I am speaking of? Are they not in Effect the same; alike absurd, and equally desperate?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I say it with Regret, but say it I must, that if some modern Builders in Theology can but set off their Doctrines, and carry them up high enough, they seem little concerned how secure they stand. Did such Measures generally prevail, we would necessarily be exposed to the lasting Contempt and Derision of our Adversaries. They would be sure to triumph, not over Christianity, that I fear not; but over the Imprudence, Temerity, and blind Zeal of its Professors.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Your</strong> Lordship<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Judgment and Practice have been the Reverse of this. Instead of raising Structures over high, and crowding them with Ornaments, it has ever been your first Care, and principal Endeavour, to make sure Work, and build upon a Rock. If you have less re<span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">re- [garded] | garded</span></span>garded Pomp, you have made us ample Amends in Strength and Substance; and whatever is wanting in Height, we have in Stability. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> your Edifices may not flourish and glitter at a Distance, as you never meant they should, yet they give singular Content near hand. They are safe, and commodious, and durable; and the greatest Advantage they can have, is to be nicely viewed, curiously inspected, and critically examined. I am speaking of the Order, Contrivance, Connection, and Uniformity of the Whole: Of the Justness of Plan, and Regularity of Design; of the Disposition, Congruity, and Symmetry of Parts. In short, the Foundations are firm, the Materials sound, and the Workmanship true; and so I doubt not they will be sound, and generally owned in future Ages.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Next</strong> to your Love of Truth, my Lord, I beg leave to take notice, of its genuine Offspring, the <em>Love of Mankind</em>, which signally appears, and shines out thro<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the whole Tenor of your <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">your [Actions,] | Actions,</span></span> Actions, as well as Writings. Be this natural, or be it acquired, I insist on the Fact. I except no Part of the Species, neither Strangers, nor Enemies, if you have any left. I have just Grounds indeed to conclude, that whoever have been the latter, must have been the former. Whatever Enemies you may have had, they never found one in you, nor ever will. They never wanted, I will not say your Candour, but even your Affection. Very happy should I think my self, had I many Friends as cordially attached to my Interest, as you have been to theirs, and all Mankind<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I am sensible that Gratitude may produce Prejudices, as well as Disaffection; but I am no way conscious, that this is my Case. However, if your Lordship<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Humanity and Benevolence are only to be judged by Persons entirely unconcerned; the Consequence will be, that they cannot be judged at all; for I verily believe such a Qualification is not to be found in any Man living.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">living. [<strong>Partial</strong>] | <strong>Partial</strong></span></span> 
<strong>Partial</strong> Affections are familiar and common; shared as it happens among Friends, Neighbours, Kindred, and Country: but an unconfined, universal Affection is not easy to be met with. On the contrary, it is perhaps one of the rarest Characters in Life.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To have a Heart open to receive, and Arms extended to embrace, the whole human Species; as it is the truest Criterion of a rational Benevolence, so it is never to be found separate from a Love of Truth and Rectitude. And in whatever Breast these Affections are jointly kindled; they produce that pure Flame which the Christian Religion meant to spread over the Face of the whole Earth.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Let</strong> no Man wonder then, that your Lordship has often pleaded the Cause of different Sects, Communions, and Denominations: befriending the Men, without any Regard to their Opinions, or Principles. Whatever their Principles might happen to be; this, I am sure, is one of yours, and I believe always will. As far as any of them <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">them [have] | have</span></span> have Reason on their Side, or not against them; they are sure of You for an Advocate. As Men, they are entitled to your Good-will; as Christians to more. Well may you regard the whole <em>Household of Faith</em>; when your Charity comprehends <em>all Men</em>, and excludes none that bear the Signature of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Image.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever Justice requires, or Humanity prompts, or Charity directs, may ever be expected from your Lord ship in Behalf either of Believers or Unbelievers. But in the midst of Benevolence you remember Truth. This you never have, never will sacrifice to either of them. Their Persons you regard, favour and esteem; their Errors you disapprove, reject, and confute. Confute in such a manner, that the Reader is equally edified by the Force of your Arguments, and the Gentleness of your Words. Even the Adversary himself, when he is not convinced by the one, is often charmed by the other. If you cannot succeed so far as to work through his Prejudices, yet you fail not <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">not [to] | to</span></span> to find a way into his Affections, and his Heart is gained, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> his Head be not. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Should any be so weak, or so perverse as to imagine, that your Lordship inclines to the Opinions of those, whose Persons you favour, and whose Interests you promote, I must take up on me to say, that such a Conclusion is grossly inconsistent, as well as injurious. By this Rule all Opinions must be yours, however repugnant, or even contradictory; for most certain it is, that the Owners of them are all Partakers of your Good-will, and even your good Offices, whenever a fit Opportunity offers. How vain, how ridiculous then must it be, to measure your Sentiments by your Favours; your Opinions by your Affections; or your Judgment by your Charity?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I beg leave, my Lord, to observe further, that as the Love of Truth naturally begets and promotes Benevolence, so Benevolence as naturally excites and cherishes a <em>Love of Liberty</em>; which under proper Limitations and <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">and [Restraints,] | Restraints,</span></span> Restraints, is not only amiable and fit; but really essential to publick Welfare. for Liberty then, both religious and civil, your Lordship has been a strenuous Advocate from the Beginning; and thereby laid your Countrymen under great Obligations, both as <em>Christians</em>, and as <em>Britons</em>. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>They</strong> are indebted to you, in a peculiar manner, not only for demolishing the wild Schemes of Patriarchal and Despotick Power; but for erecting in their stead that glorious Pile of solid Reasoning, and sound Politicks, which protects our just Liberties, and deserves to be reckoned among the principal Bulwarks of our Constitution. I say our just Liberties, because your Lordship never contended for any other: Such as are equally opposed to Arbitrariness on one hand, and Licentiousness on the other: Such as may become the most virtuous People, and be worthy of the wisest and most civilized Nations; as standing on the Basis of <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">of [publick] | publick</span></span> publick Good, and the immutable Rules of Truth and Equity.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Nor</strong> have your Endeavours, my Lord, been less vigorous, or less valuable, in Defence of Religious Liberty; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>, I presume, less understood, and therefore less acknowledged. But this being a Subject, either too copious, or too invidious, to be entred [!!!] into on this Occasion, I only beg leave to observe, that however some Men may have misinterpreted your Doctrine, or others made an ill Use of it; this neither affects the Truth of your Opinions, nor the Goodness of your Intentions. If I know any thing of the latter, they were most unfeignedly directed to the Honour of Christianity, and the Peace and Prosperity of Christians.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I may safely take upon me to affirm, that nothing was more remote from your Lordship<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Design, than Anarchy of any kind; that most certainly you never meant to oppose Order and just Rule, but merely Usurpa<span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">Usurpa- [tion] | tion</span></span>tion and Misrule; that, far from intending to break down the Fences of Religion and Government, your sole Aim was to preserve Men from Force and Oppression, Fetters and Bondage. And how laudable are these Views! How glorious such Pursuits! I may add, how grievous, obnoxious, and perplexing? Whoever engages in them, must never expect a gentle Task. Discountenance, Malevolence, Opposition, and Misconstruction, are sure to be his Fate. But Constancy and Patience surmount all Difficulties; and while Errors and Prejudices are dying every Day, Truth is immortal. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Of</strong> this Nature were my original Sentiments, published long ago; and even some Years before you discovered, or conjectured, from whence they came. Let me be excused, if I observe, in relation to your Lordship, that the Acquaintance which I have been since honoured with, has been so far from altering my Ideas, that it has confirmed and fixed them; and whoever has the <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">the [same] | same</span></span> same Opportunity, will certainly receive the same Impression. Let him think as he <em>may</em> of your Books and Writings; <em>for</em> them, or <em>against</em> them; I assuredly know what he must think of the Author. Concerning the former, let Posterity determine; concerning the latter, they are best able to judge, who have been most intimate with your Lordship. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I fear, my Lord, you will charge me with making an extravagant Use of the Privilege of a Dedication: And, in truth, I have been not very studious in this Epistle, either of your Inclination, or Approbation. I dare own, and even make it my Boast, that, in drawing it up, I have been chiefly governed by quite other Views, and Considerations, than either pleasing or displeasing your Lordship, or indeed any Man living. However then you may blame me for saying too much, or the Publick complain of my saying too little; I must beg to be excused both ways; <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">ways; [espe-] | especially</span></span> especially since I cannot gratify either, without giving more Offence to the other. Very sure I am, that I have not incurred the Reproach of my own Mind, that only excepted, of sinking so far beneath the Dignity of my Subject.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
Thus far, my Lord, I had long ago written, and deposited a Copy in a proper Hand, that it might be in a Readiness for the Press, whenever my Tracts should happen to be collected. But while these are printing off, I have the Pleasure to find your Lordship translated to the See of <em>Winchester</em>; an Event so grateful to all Lovers of Light and Liberty, that it must unavoidably expose you to a long Course of Gratulations both publick and private. Mine I beg leave to insert here, and to conclude my Epistle with them; not only for the sake of testifying my Joy, but in order to justify both, in the amplest and most effectual manner.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">manner. [Should] | Should</span></span>
Should either You, my Lord, or your Enemies object, that the foregoing Sketch of a Character is over-drawn, or carried too far, in any Respect; why may I not refer both you and them to this decisive Events How could I have wished for a mote authentick Testimony of the Justice of my Cause, and the Truth of my Assertions? Or what Sanction, in the Eyes of all unprejudiced Men, can be thought surer and stronger? And yet I would not take Refuge even under This Authority, high as it is; were it not confessedly founded on Wisdom more than on Power: And were it not, at the same time, an open Demonstration, both of your Lordship<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Fidelity to the Crown acting under its present happy Limitations for the publick Good; and, if I may presume to mention it, of the sincere Regard of the Crown to the true Liberty of the Subject, so often and so zealously defended by your Lordship.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">Lordship. [To] | To</span></span> 
To stop here is no easy Matter, considering what a fresh Field of Reflection lies open before me: But stop I must, lest I wander out of my Sphere, as well as beyond the Bounds of your Lordship<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Patience.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To conclude therefore; &mdash; That your Honours and Dignities may be crowned with Length of Days, and lasting Tranquillity; that you may happily survive all Strife, Animosity, and Faction in the State; and all Prejudice, Bigotry, and blind Zeal, whether in, or out of the Church; that pure Religion, and undefiled Christianity may flourish, even in your Time, to the Height and Extent of your Wishes; that you may live to see Peace and Truth, Controversy and Charity, Liberty and Loyalty, as compleatly reconciled in Fact, as they are in Idea; and the Tumults and Agitations of Mens Minds subsiding and settling into as perfect a Calm as human Frailty will admit: In fine, that full of Years, and possess<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d of universal Esteem and Veneration, you <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds">you [may] | may</span></span> may at length exchange this transitory State for a blessed and glorious Immortality:&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;These are the unfeigned Wishes, and earnest: Prayers of,

THE PREFACE. 
</div>

<div class="unindented numbered">
<em><span class="dropcap"><span>T</span>HE</span> Collection of these Tracts at this Time may appear perhaps improper and unseasonable to the Reader, if he happens to recollect what was proposed at the Conclusion of one of them<span class="punct2">;</span> I mean that of</em> Divine Rectitude<em><span class="punct2">;</span> where, after a brief application of this Principle to the Doctrines of</em> Creation <em>and</em> Providence<em>, a Design was mentioned of considering those of</em> Redemption<em>, and a</em> Future State <em>in the same Light. This</em> <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>This</em> [<em>Design</em>,] <em>Design</em>,</span></span> <em>Design, however deferred in the Execution, has neither been dropped, nor neglected. On the contrary, those Subjects have not only been much in the Authors Thoughts, but an Essay on the former of them, in the Manner intended, has lain by him a considerable Time. Why no sooner written, and why not now published, are Points of so little Consequence to the Publick, that he would think it impertinent to take the least Notice of them here, had he not been sometimes questioned about them, and called upon to communicate his Reasons.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>ONE</strong> of them has been, and still is, an Expectation of Dr.</em> Tindall<em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Second, and, as it may now be called, posthumous Volume, whose Reasonings in the former, on this Head, having been examined and replied to in the forementioned Essay, it was judged adviseable to wait for his further Thoughts, since it can scarce be doubted but this important Doctrine, or others closely connected with it, must have been re</em><span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>re</em>- [<em>sumed</em><span class="punct2">;</span>] | <em>sumed</em><span class="punct2">;</span></span></span><em>sumed<span class="punct2">;</span> and either new Arguments and Objections produced, or old ones dress<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d up in different Colours. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
ANOTHER, and indeed the principal Reason of this Delay, is, that the Author found himself obliged, in treating this difficult Subject, to strike out of the common Road of Explication. Though, concerning the Substance of the Doctrine, no Doubts occurred, nor Difficulty appeared in reconciling it with the Principle before him<span class="punct">;</span> yet to explain the Manner of it consistently herewith, seemed to require more Attention, and Deliberation, than perhaps is commonly apprehended. And yet this was incumbent on him from the very Nature of his Design<span class="punct2">;</span> and if he left it undone, he lost his Labour.

Supposing them erroneous, they may give a Handle, as Errors frequently do, for the Discovery of Truth. But to take time, review them often, and weigh them well, can do no Harm, and may be of Use. And if it argue a Diffidence of himself and a Deference to the Publick, certainly neither the one nor the other can need any Excuse, especially since he is determined to break through both on a proper Occasion, unless prevented by an abler and more useful Performance.

AFTER all, it would perhaps be more decent, as well as pertinent, to apologize for what is published, rather</em> <span class="epagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>rather</em> [<em>than</em>] <em>than</em></span></span> <em>than for what is not; especially considering how the Press labours, and Readers are glutted. On this Account Forbearance and Delay may seem not only excusable, but lay Claim to some kind of Merit. However, this is only a Collection, and not a fresh Work, neither will it take up so much Room as a Number of scattered Pieces.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;A further and a better Plea is, that the Subjects treated in it are confessedly of the utmost Importance; such indeed as can never be unseasonable, or out of Vogue with the thinking Part of Mankind. The Nature and Grounds of Virtue and Religion will not fail to find a Place in Mens Thoughts, till they are quite abandoned to the Pursuits of Sense, and sunk into the very Dregs of animal Life.

On the contrary, they ordinarily produce crude Notions, Sceptical Opinions, and wild Ways of Thinking. In the Culture of the Mind, as in that of Land, the immediate Fruits are seldom clear and unmixed. The first Crops are generally full of Weeds and Trash; and perhaps the richer the Soil, the ranker they shoot. Certainly the proper Rule in this Case is not to cease the Cultivation, but to carry it on, and compleat it.

TO think freely is the undeniable Privilege of Mans Nature; but to think fairly is much more; as being it self a great Virtue, and indeed the Root of many others. Would but Men shake off their Prejudices, and instead of Affections, judge with their Understandings; none but Lovers of Darkness and Dominion could ever grudge them Encrease of Light and Liberty. Then their Range might be free, and unconfined, without Damage to the Publick, or Danger to themselves. But, alas! Impartiality and Fidelity of Judgment, seem not to keep pace with their other Improvements. And indeed Men seldom take due Pains to bring them on; as expecting them to advance in Course.

Instead of searching for Evidence, they often shut it out, and labour to suppress it. And when they do submit to receive it, there is usually required a previous Concurrence of the most favourable Circumstances. After it has worked thro<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> a great Croud [!!!] of Prejudices, and waited for the Ebbing of Passion; after it has soothed their Humours, and courted their Inclinations, and compounded with their Interest; at length, perhaps, the Door is opened, and they condescend to be in some measure convinced. But why all these Clogs and Incumbrances? And what is it that Men propose by encouraging, or even suffering such an Abuse and Perversion of their heft Faculty?

To play Tricks with the Eye of the Mind, for the Convenience of Delusion, or the Pleasure of seeing double, is a Practice so childish, senseless, and pernicious, that it is hard to say, whether the Ignominy or the Injury be the greater.

WHILE this is the Case, or in Proportion to the Degree wherein it prevails, the Means of Knowledge are insignificant. In vain do Men heap up Materials, and extend their Inquiries. A Multitude of Perceptions may amuse perhaps, but not edify; entertain, but not enlighten. An irregular and depraved judgment turns every thing to Trumpery, or something worse. Nevertheless, however this Faculty be neglected or abused, a large Provision is often made both for the Imagination, and the Understanding.

LETTER 

TO A 

DEIST.

SIR,
</div>

<div class="unindented numbered">
<span class="dropcap"><span>I</span></span> HAVE again perused with fresh Pleasure, and fresh Concern, the Volumes of <strong>Characteris&shy;ticks</strong> which you was pleased to present me with some time ago. And I assure you, the Condition of Impartiality, which you imposed on me, has been punctually observed. I heartily wish the Noble Author had been as unprejudiced in Writing, as I was in Reading. If he had, I am persuaded his Readers would have found double Pleasure, and double Instruction. It seems to me, that his Lordship had little or no Temptation to pursue any Singularities of Opinion by Way of Distinction. His fine Genius would sufficiently have distinguished him <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">him [from] | from</span></span> from vulgar Authors, in the High-Road of Truth and good Sense; on which Account his Deviations seem the more to be lamented. The Purity and Politeness of his Style, and the Delicacy of his Sentiments, are, and must be acknowledged by all Readers of Taste and Sincerity. But nevertheless, as his Beauties are not easy to be overlooked, so neither are his Blemishes. His Works appear to be stained with so many gross Errors, and his fine Thoughts are so often mingled with Absurdities, that however we may be charmed with the one, we are forced to condemn the other.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> is but a small Matter that the Clergy are the constant Mark of his Satire. They who are prejudiced against the Christian Religion, are naturally disgusted at its Ministers: Nor do I know, Sir, an Instance to the contrary, excepting your self. But considering what a general Affection for Mankind, what an universal Benevolence our great Author maintains, and recommends; it is somewhat difficult to account for that Rancour, that Keenness of Spirit, which appears in his Writings, whenever he touches upon our Profession. Any accidental Mention of it kindles his Displeasure, and brings us under Correction. Let but the Idea of our Function cross his Way; immediately he quits the Game he is in Pursuit of, and does us the Honour to hunt us for several Pages together. Nor does he think fit to single out Particulars, but <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">but [levels] | levels</span></span> levels and lets fly at the whole Order. Such a Proceeding as this needs no Remarks of mine; and they are still less necessary in writing to you, who as you never follow the Example, so you have too much Humanity and Justice so utter a Syllable in Defence of it. I shall therefore only observe how it would have looked, supposing he had laid it down in the Form of a Proposition, and inserted it into his Doctrine: It is natural and reasonable to shew Benevolence, and be well affectioned towards all Mankind, excepting the Ministers of the Gospel.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I am equally at a Loss to account for that extraordinary Way of Thinking, which appears in his <em>Essay on Wit and Humour</em>. To make <em>Raillery</em> the Test of right Reason; and <em>Ridicule</em> the Touchstone of Truth, is to maintain something that far exceeds the Bounds of a Paradox. I must own I cannot but wonder, whenever I think of it, that so able and accurate a Writer could ever take it into his Head, to advance such an uncouth, absurd Notion. All I can make of it is, that his Lordship had a Mind to divert himself With some Speculation entirely new, and peculiar to himself: Such as no Man had ever entertained before him, and none would be likely to entertain after him.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> is neither my Intention, nor your Desire, that I should go through the <em>Characteristicks</em>, and point out whatever may seem liable to Objection. This is a Work, for <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">for [for] | which,</span></span> which, at present, I have neither Time nor Inclination. I am glad therefore that you have confined me to the <em>Enquiry concerning Virtue</em>; where I shall find little more to do, than to tell you how much I admire it. I think it indeed, in the main, a Performance so just and exact, as to deserve higher Praises than I am able to give it: But notwithstanding this Acknowledgment, I cannot agree every Particular contained in it. And you must give me leave to add, Sir, that the very Point with which you seem to be most pleased, appears to me the most exceptionable. I mean that low and disadvantageous Account he has given of those religious Motives, which both Reason and Revelation set before us. I cannot but think he has carried the Notion of Disinterest too far, and am sorry to find that you seem to carry it still farther.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Before</strong> I trouble you with my Reasons, it may be very fitting to make the following Concessions. I can by no means approve of that Doctrine, which resolves all Morality in to Self-interest: A Doctrine that not only debases Virtue, but sinks it to a Level with the most indifferent Actions. Whenever these happen to be equally profitable, they become, according to this Opinion, equally eligible. Are there then no Propensities, no Inclinations in our Nature, drawing us, as it were, out of ourselves in behalf of our Fellow-Creatures, even to the Neglect of what we call Self-Advantage? Is there likewise no intrinsick Goodness in Virtue to ascertain its Supe<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Supe- [riority,] | riority,</span></span>riority, and determine our Preference? Suppose it in any Substance unprofitable; suppose it prejudicial, would it cease to be Virtue? Would the eternal and immutable Relations of Things be hereby destroyed? It might be said indeed, in such a Case, that its Obligations were suspended or over-ruled; but still, its Nature would remain the same, nor would it lose any Thing of its own intrinsick Worthiness. We may be suppose to be placed in such Circumstances, as to be incapable of practising it; and such a Supposition may shew how much it wants to be supported by Rewards: but these Rewards have no Influence, no Effect upon Virtue itself, whatever Effects they may have upon us.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I look upon it as a certain Truth, that nothing can be more binding upon reasonable Creatures than Reason; and that a good Law obliges as much, if not more than the Legislator himself. God has no Superior to prescribe Laws to him, and yet is eternally bound by the Rectitude of own Nature; that is, the Rules of right Reason. These are so many Laws to him, which he perpetually and inviolably observes: They strictly and formally oblige him; nor can the Obligation be ever dissolved: And yet no Profit, no Advantage arises to him from thence, as being incapable of receiving any. Whoever affirms that God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Goodness to his Creatures is, in any respect, serviceable to himself; must also affirm, that he is more happy since the Creation, than he was before, and that the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [Crea-] | Creation&nbsp;was</span></span> Creation was necessary to compleat his Happiness; which being evidently impossible, it follows, that the Goodness of God is entirely independent on Self-interest, and has not the least Connection with it. And since his Goodness is most perfect, does it not also follow, that the more ours resembles his, the nearer it approaches to Perfection; and by consequence the more disinterested, the more perfect? Very true; but then we must remember the infinite Disparity of Nature and Condition. If ours be such, that it will not suffer us in many Cases to practise this most perfect Virtue, we must be content with that which is less perfect. And if we pursue this as far as we can, we shall have no Reason to complain, or be dissatisfied. But to return, I think it appears from what I have said, that nothing can tend more to the Disparagement and Diminution of Virtue, than to found it thus on Self-interest. Whatever may be said of some other Kinds of Virtue, yet social Virtue or Benevolence must stand upon another Foot, or fall to the Ground. For no Services, no Acts of Beneficence to our Fellow-Creatures can be virtuous, while we are destitute of all Affection for them, and mean nothing but the serving of ourselves. Were it otherwise, it would follow, that human Virtues were nothing more than so many Modifications of Self Love. And upon the same Supposition, human Goodness would be of a quite different Nature from Divine Goodness, as appears from <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">from [what] | what</span></span> what I have just now observed; which is as much as to say, that it would be no Goodness at all.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> after all, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> Interest can never enter into the Nature and Constitution of Virtue, yet why may it not be allowed to accompany and stand beside her? notwithstanding all that has been granted, I can see no Reason why Virtue, and the Rewards of Virtue must needs be separated, and set at Variance. Its Excellencies and Advantages seem by God and Nature to be joined together, and why should Man attempt to put them asunder? Let Virtue be decked in all her Charms; let her be painted as lovely a Form as is possible; there is no Danger of the Picture<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s out doing the Original. But still, what Reason can any Man have to strip her of her Dowry, and present her empty-handed? The Royal Moralist has represented her otherwise; and in Conformity to his Description, why may she not be set forth as holding temporal Advantages in one Hand, and a blessed Immortality in the other?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>You</strong> say, that Views and Intentions of Self-Good, in proportion to the Extent of their Influence, are destructive of Virtue. And I grant, if they destroy Benevolence, they destroy Virtue. Or if they diminish the former, they in Proportion diminish the latter. But I am not able to discover that they do either the one or the other.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;A certain Person believes nothing either of Providence or a <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">a [future] | future</span></span> future State; but yet has a considerable Share of Benevolence: And this Benevolence prompts him to suitable Acts of Kindness and Beneficence. Suppose him afterwards convinced of those great Truths, what Effect would they have upon him? Would they take away, or lessen his Benevolence? I see no Reason to suppose it. For how should a Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s aiming to procure himself Happiness in another World, render him either disaffected, or less kind to his Brethren in this? Since that Happiness is supposed common to all that will qualify themselves for it, there can be no interfering, no Competition of Interest to occasion Contention, and impair Benevolence. And what else should do it, I cannot conceive. You will say perhaps, that though his Benevolence do remain the same, yet that he is not equally influenced by it. That the new Motives which his Conviction has introduced, must affect his Determinations, and proportionably detract from the Merit and Virtue of his good Actions. To which I answer, That however the new Motives may operate, they cannot hinder the Efficacy of the old one. Whatever Good they may produce over and above, (as indeed much may be expected from their Conjunction with the former Principle) yet still the Benevolence being supposed, the same in Degree must, I think, remain the same in Force and Influence. But let us hear what the Author of the <em>Characteristicks</em> says about this Matter:

<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Nor can Fear or Hope consist in reality with Virtue or Goodness, if it stand as a considerable Motive to any Act, of which some better Affection ought alone, to have been a sufficient Cause.</em> Again,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>In this Religious Discipline,</em> (<em>viz.</em> of Hope and Fear) [first parenth italic]<em> the Principle of Self-Love, which is naturally so prevailing in us, being improved and made stronger every Day by the Exercise of the Passions in a Subject of more extended Self-interest, there may be Reason to apprehend, lest the Temper of this Kind should extend it self in general through all the Parts of Life. For, if the Habit be such, as to occasion in every Particular, a stricter Attention to Self-Good, and Interest, it must insensibly diminish the Affections towards Publick Good, and introduce a certain Narrowness of Spirit.</em> Whether by this, the Author did not mean to shew, or insinuate the Inconvenience and Damage that Virtue sustains from the future and in visible Motives of Religion, let the Reader judge. My Business is to shew, if I can, that these <em>Apprehensions</em> are groundless; and that in some Cases, <em>a strict Attention to Self-Good</em>, is of great Service to the Publick.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If I be not much deceived, the Motives of Religion are so far from weakening or lessening Benevolence, that they naturally tend to increase and strengthen it. By these Motives I mean the <em>positive</em> Rewards which we believe Revelation has set before us, added to those Ad<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ad- [van-] | vantages</span></span>vantages and Enjoyments which <em>naturally</em> flow from Virtue. That is, that complex Good, which is meant by a blessed Immortality, of whatsoever Ingredients it may consist. Let it then be considered, what Effects the Expectation of this great and endless Happiness is like to have on the Minds of Men. Now I think it naturally tends to give them great Peace and Tranquillity of Mind, and to make them habitually well pleased and joyful, in proportion to the Strength of their Hopes. The Question then is, Whether this Tranquillity and Joy do not as naturally tend to increase and cherish Benevolence; and by consequence contribute to that <em>Goodness of Temper</em> which our Author requires. This I own is no Question with me: However, I am willing it should be determined by Experience and Observation. Recollect, Sir, what vou have seen and known, and tell me whether, <em>c&aelig;teris Paribus</em>, those Men be not most benevolent and kindly disposed, who are best pleased with their Hopes and Prospects. Do not compare this to those Mechanical Affections, which rise and fall with our Spirits, and depend on the little Accidents and Events of human Life. For, as this is regular and constant as the Cause which produced it, so it is aided by Reason, and strengthens by Reflection.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;When Men consider how their Labours here will be recompensed and crowned hereafter, and what an inexhaustible Fund of Happiness God has provided for them in <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">in [the] | the</span></span> the next Life; their Minds are filled not only with pleasing Expectations of their own Bliss, but with a grateful Sense of his Bounty and Goodness: And since they cannot possibly make him any Requital, their Gratitude naturally flows out in Streams of Kindness upon their Fellow-Creatures. This, I say, is not only natural, but highly agreeable to Reason, and even Revelation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Again, how must it endear good Men to one another, to consider themselves as Persons designed for a perpetual Cohabitation hereafter? Members of an immortal Society, and Friends and Companions for ever! Here are Bonds of Love, and Principles of Benevolence, which only Religion can furnish; and which entirely depend on the Rewards of Futurity.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;On the other hand, if we suppose Mankind without any Hope, any Prospect in another World; expecting nothing more, than as soon as this Life was done, to perish and be extinct; such a Thought, such a Belief as this, would be sufficient, to damp every good Design, and strike all Virtue dead. Upon this Supposition, how few would give them selves Trouble to do good Offices either for others, or themselves? Who would think it worth his while to exert himself vigorously in the Service of the Publick, if he knew that in a few Years, both he and they were to lose their Existence, and sink together in to utter Oblivion? Men would then almost give themselves up to sad Thoughts, and gloomy Reflections; and in such a dejected, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">dejected, [dis-] | disconsolate</span></span> disconsolate State as this, what Room, what Encouragement to cultivate virtuous Dispositions? Surely Benevolence must, at least, thrive ill in such a Soil. In short, to prescribe and preach up Virtue without a future State, appears to me no otherwise than as a sort of religious Knight-Errantry. However Men may gaze or listen for a while, they will never be influenced by a Doctrine that is carried so high, as to be above the Principles of human Nature.

<strong>Upon</strong> the whole, what our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s real Opinion was concerning Futurity, he has not thought fit to inform us, nor shall I presume to determine. He often throws out oblique Hints against <em>Infinite Rewards</em>; and as often speaks in Favour of <em>common and natural Motives:</em> But what to conclude from hence, perhaps you, Sir, may know better than I do, I shall therefore leave these Ambiguities and Uncertainties, and proceed to something that is clearer.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;He has expressly granted, that the Principle of Rewards and Punishments, <em>how mercenary or servile soever it may be accounted, is yet in many Circumstances a great Advantage, Security, and Support to Virtue</em>.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> And since you seem to be so far of a different Opinion in respect of Rewards, as to make Virtue its own sufficient Reward, and to think it depreciated by any other; I must desire you to peruse and weigh what the Author has added about this Matter. In the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [mean] | mean</span></span> mean time give me leave to offer you the following Considerations.

<div class="indented numbered">
<aside class="sidenote">
<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Enquiry into the Original Ideas of Beauty and Virtue.</span>
</aside>
<strong>Let</strong> it be observed then in the first place, how small a Proportion of Mankind are capable of discerning, in any considerable Degree, the inward Beauty and Excellence of Virtue. In the <em>Characteristicks</em> we find a <em>good Taste</em> required for this Purpose; and whether that Taste be derived from Nature or Education, there is little Reason to expect it should be found in the Bulk of Mankind. Nor will even that <em>Moral Sense</em>, which an excellent Writer has of late contended for in another <em>Enquiry</em>,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> prove much more effectual. For suppose it to be as real and extensive as he represents it, yet if it be not kept up and cherished by Care, Attention, and the Practice of Virtue, it must soon grow dull, if it be not almost extinguished. How then can it be imagined, that in respect of the generality of the World, it should be sufficient for the Support of Morality, and the Maintenance of Virtue? I need not further observe how little Probability there is of their arriving at such a Knowledge by abstracted Reasonings and Speculations. To expect indeed any way that the greatest Part of Mankind should have just Ideas of Virtue, and understand its Worth; is to expect that the greatest Part of Mankind should become Philosophers.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But supposing the Excellence of Virtue were in a good measure perceived <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">perceived [by] | by</span></span> by them, how would they be effected by it? What slight Hold would such intellectual Beauties take on the Understandings of the Vulgar; and how feebly would they operate upon them? It must be something more substantial that can make any considerable Impression on their gross Minds: Something that can either strike their Senses, or work upon their Passions. And what can be fitter for this Purpose than Rewards and Punishments? These excite their strongest Passions, and work upon Mankind more powerfully than any thing else could do. Most certain it is; that whensoever these fail to bring Men to their Duty; nothing would be sufficient; nothing, I mean, less than Compulsion, which is inconsistent with our Nature. The Wisdom and Goodness of God are very conspicuous therefore in this Provision for our Security. Such strong Sanctions Were absolutely necessary. And however vicious Men may be with them, they would have been infinitely more so without them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> further; To discover the Necessity of these Motives, we ought to consider a great Part of Mankind as deeply engaged in sinful Courses. It is reasonable to think, that regard must be had to the reclaiming of these. To facilitate the Conversion of evil Men, you will allow, Sir, to be an Intention worthy of infinite Goodness. Is then the Excellence of Virtue to be looked upon as a Cause adequate to such an Effect? Was it proper that the Reformation of the Wicked should be wholly left <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">left [to] | to</span></span> to their own Reason; or, if you will, to that <em>Moral Sense</em> before spoken of? Alas! their Reason is exceedingly darkened and depraved; and their Moral Sense must be grown very languid, if it be not quite lost. Represent to a vicious Man the Beauty of Virtue, you speak to him in a Language that he does not understand. Let Virtue herself plead her own Cause, and set forth her own Merit, he will not so much as <em>hear the Voice of the Charmer</em>. His Eyes, his Ears, his Heart are fixed upon quite different Objects; insomuch that all Attempts from this Quarter are utterly lost upon him. But let him be told, that the Paths in which he is engaged lead to his Ruin; that he is incurring endless Misery, and forfeiting eternal Happiness: This may probably work upon him, if he be not quite incorrigible. Such forcible Arguments will prevail, if any thing can. In short, a strong Attachment to Sin produced by Inclination, and confirmed by Custom, all Men allow is hard to be broken. I would only ask then, whether your Principle taken alone, or reinforced by Gospel-Motives, be more likely to do it? I believe you will be so reasonable, and so ingenuous as to say the latter.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But perhaps you will add, that Converts thus made, are not Converts to Virtue, as being acted and swayed merely by Considerations of Interest.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I have already told you why I cannot agree to such a Conclusion: But here I must reject it upon another Account. He who removes out of the Ways of Vice into the Ways <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ways [of] | of</span></span> of Virtue, wholly from a Regard to his own Safety and Welfare, may, and probably will, if he continue therein, be influenced afterwards by higher Considerations, and become virtuous at last even upon your own Principle. This is a natural Supposition: The Author of the <em>Characteristicks</em> takes notice of it; and I doubt not but it is often verified in Fact. And indeed what wonder if a Man, who embraces Virtue upon any Principle, discover the Beauty and Excellency of it sooner than he who is wallowing in Sin and Sensuality? And this, if I mistake not, clearly shews the Usefulness and Advantage of the Motives that I am defending. They draw Men out of their Evil Courses, which no other Inducements have Power to do; and then commit them into the Hands of Virtues to be taught and instructed by her ever after. And thus having so fair an Opportunity of discovering her Worth, it is not to be imagined that they will long continue Strangers to it. Be reconciled then, Sir, to those Motives which you have hitherto disapproved; if it be for no other Reason, than that they manifestly support and strengthen your own Principle.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Another</strong> Proof how useful these Motives are to Virtue, and how necessary to support it, may be drawn from a State of Suffering; and more especially from the Case of Persecution. A considerate Mind that is at Ease, unmolested by Want, or Grief, or Pain, may be supposed capable of observing the Ex<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ex- [cellence] | cellence</span></span>cellence of Virtue, and of receiving suitable Impressions from it. He is at Leisure to reflect upon it without Distraction, and the more he reflects, the more Reason he will find to approve and admire it. But when a Man is sunk into Adversity, and has various Hardships to struggle with; especially when these Hardships are occasioned and brought upon him by his Adherence to Virtue; will he not then want some further Support than Virtue is able to give him? What Consolation can she pour into an afflicted and sorrowful Breast? What Remedies can she administer to heal his Grief, and sooth him in his Sufferings? She may still appear lovely in his Eyes; still display her Beauty, and shine out with her usual Lustre: But is this sufficient to mitigate his Pains, or dispel the thick Gloom that hangs over his Heart?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Extol Virtue, Sir; as much as you can; exhaust your Eloquence in her Praise: Yet after all, Truth will oblige you to acknowledge, that she is impotent in the Day of Adversity, and not capable alone of supporting Men in Distress. The <em>Stoicks</em> indeed denied this with great Resolution and Obstinacy; but their boastful Declarations On this Head, were in reality only so many Insults upon human Nature, and Contradictions to common Experience.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Most certainly nothing can support a Man under the Pressure of any great Evil, but the Hope and Prospect of succeeding Good: And if he suffers in the Cause of Virtue, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>tis plain that something is wanting to <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">to [make] | make</span></span> make up her Deficiencies, and compensate his Sufferings. So that here again we perceive the great Usefulness of those Rewards and Encouragements which Heaven has annexed to Virtue, and entailed upon her Votaries. Here is more than an Equivalent for the most grievous Sufferings; a Comfort administred, that has Strength and Substance capable of bearing up the most dejected Spirits, and <em>sustaining</em> all their <em>Infirmities</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But this Observation will still appear to have greater Weight, if we extend it to the Case of Persecution. Let us consider a Man suffering Martyrdom, and be hold him led by Truth and Virtue to a Stake: In this Extremity, how is he to be supported? Whither can he turn for Relief? What can bare Virtue do for him, in the Height of Torture, and the Agonies of Death? Would he not naturally fly out into <em>Brutus</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s<em></em> Exclamation, and loudly complain that Virtue had betrayed him? Would you expect to support and comfort him in his last Moments, by a lively Representation of her Charms? Alas! it would avail no more at that Juncture than the Contemplation of some fine Picture. Whereas, let but Religion step into his Aid, and lift up his Eyes to those Joys and Glories that she has prepared for him above; he is Comforted at once; his Torments are in a manner forgotten: The Flames have lost their Force, and <em>Death</em> its <em>Sting</em>, and he passes triumphant into another World.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> desire, Sir, you will not look upon this as a Flight of Enthusiasm, or a fanciful De<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">De- [scription] | scription</span></span>scription carried beyond the Bounds of Truth. The History of our Religion furnishes us with a Multitude of Vouchers, and sets before us many Instances of the Power and Efficacy of those Motives against which you object; and that in such Circumstances as I have been speaking of.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And the same might be observed in respect of the Temptations incident to Prosperity, which would be more powerful and prevailing than they are, if it were not for the Influences of another World.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Does it not appear then from the foregoing Considerations, that these Motives greatly befriend Virtue, and strengthen her Interests? We plainly see she is not self-sufficient; and how could her Defects be better supplied, than by those Rewards which Revelation has offered Men? I desire no more, than that they may be looked upon as her Auxiliaries; and such, I think, upon an impartial Enquiry, you must discover them to be.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> might further observe, that Mankind is much indebted to these Motives, as they occasion the doing of much more Good in the World than otherwise would be done. Much Disorder, much Mischief is hereby prevented; and many Actions performed, highly beneficial to the Publick, as well as advantageous to private Persons. And supposing such Actions were in no Case, and in no Degree, truly Virtuous; yet since so much Benefit redounds from them, and they so much conduce to <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">to [the] | the</span></span> the Welfare of Mankind; that Principle from whence they spring, must be allowed to be very useful. Were we to subtract from the Good that has been done in the World, that Share which was owing to Prospects of Advantage, and Views of Interest; the Remainder, in all likelihood, would not be very considerable. And yet this Remainder would have been the Whole, if we suppose Virtue stripped of all Advantages, and left to herself.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As Man is a reasonable Creature, he is capable of discovering, and admiring the intrinsick Excellence of Virtue; but nevertheless, as he is conscious of his own Indigence and Infirmity, he cannot well pretend to neglect those Appendages of Interest that belong to her. <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>Tis Vanity and Presumption in him to slight those Advantages which are so necessary to his Well-being. On the other hand, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>tis mean and mercenary to pursue those Advantages alone. To prevent both, God has closely connected our Duty and Interest, and interwoven them together. And this Conjunction has been of great Service to Mankind at all Times, and upon all Occasions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I believe it may be said, that from this complicated Principle have flowed all those great and illustrious Actions that make such a Figure in History, and have been the Delight and Admiration of all Ages. Many of the ancient Heroes of <em>Greece</em> and <em>Rome</em> had a lively Sense of Virtue, and were especially famous for the Love of their Country, and an inviolable Attachment to the In<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">In- [terests] | terests</span></span>terests thereof: But was this the only Principle that prompted them to act so heroically, and deserve so well of Mankind? Were they not also excited and animated by an ardent Thirst: after Glory? Did they not expect to immortalize their Names, and perpetuate the Fame of their Actions? When <em>Socrates</em> fell a Sacrifice to Truth and Virtue, did he not propose to please God and procure his Favour? A nobler View indeed than the other; but yet it was a View of Interest, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> such a one as Virtue can never be ashamed of. A Desire to please the supreme Being, and obtain his Approbation, is so wise and worthy an Intention, so just a Principle of Action, so agreeable to the Dictates of right Reason, and the genuine Inclinations of human Nature, that it may seem to rival the purest and most disinterested Love of Virtue, or at least to claim a Place very near it. In <em>Socrates</em> they were joined together, as indeed they always ought to be. His exalted Mind, saw what only Revelation could teach others; that to disunite Virtue and Interest, and follow either, separately, was to act contrary to Nature, and the Rules of sound Wisdom: And while others devoted themselves to the Pursuit of earthly Fame and human Praise, that Shadow of Honour; he found out and followed the Substance; striving to recommend himself to that Being, in whose Approbation consists the Perfection of all Glory. In short, that he left this World with so much <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">much [In-] | Indifference,</span></span> Indifference, or rather Inclination, was owing to the strong Hopes he had of the Joys and Glories of another.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Of his Character and Conduct (perhaps the best in all the Heathen World) I have taken more particular Notice, that it might dispose you to hear with less Prejudice what is expressly owned concerning the great Founders of our Religion; or at least, to obviate such Exceptions as you might otherwise be apt to make. When it is said, that the one <em>had respect to the Recompence of Reward</em>, and that the other <em>endured the Cross, and despised the Shame, for the Joy that was set before him</em>; this is abundant Authority for us Believers, and fully assures us, that the mixed Principle before-mentioned is perfectly right. We are hence throughly [!!!] convinced, that Interest may be regarded and proposed, without any Diminution of Virtue, or Derogation from it; and in short, that they are and ought to be indissolubly united. As you disown this Authority, I am content to refer you to the Reason of the Thing; only desiring, as I justly may, that what was never objected against <em>Socrates</em>, may not be objected against <em>Moses</em> and <em>Christ</em>.

<strong>Having</strong> complied with your Request, and laid before you my Sentiments, though briefly, concerning a Book that you think fit to call your <em>Oracle</em>; and that is esteemed and studied by you accordingly; Let me intreat you in my Turn, to resume and re-examine with the same impartiality that you required from me, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">me, [that] | that</span></span> that Book which we believe to be truly and strictly <em>Oracular</em>: Bring along with you that Veneration for Morality and Virtue which you profess, and try whether you cannot find in the <em>New Testament</em> the noblest Precepts and sublimest Patterns that you ever met with. As you may there discover the Reasonableness, the Fitness, the Usefulness of those Motives which I have been contending for; so you may observe notwithstanding, the most exalted Benevolence both taught and exemplified.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;You may there have the Pleasure of perceiving all human Duty resolved into the Love of God and Man. You will also find Self-love made the Rule of our Love for others; and all Behaviour, all Proceedings towards others forbidden, except such as we judge to be reasonable towards ourselves: You will find real Affection and unfeigned Good-Will essentially constituting Christian Charity; and all outward Acts of Beneficence declared to be ineffectual and worthless, that do not proceed from that inward Principle: You will find Benevolence and Kindness laid down as the Rule by which Men will be finally judged; and those represented as most deserving, who do the most good in proportion to their Abilities: But what I would more particularly point out to your Observation, is the Extent and Diffusiveness of Christian Benevolence, which comprehends, as you would wish it to do, the whole Species, and spreads itself over the Face of the whole Earth. Instead of that <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">that [partial] | partial</span></span> partial Love, those contracted Affections whether for Kindred, Neighbours, Friends or Country, which both <em>Jews</em> and <em>Gentiles</em> were too apt to run into, and even make their Boast of; Christianity requires us to love all without Distinction, and opening our Arms as wide as possible, embrace Mankind with an universal Good-Will. How will you be able to forbear admiring the Nobleness and Generosity of those Precepts, which throwing down the narrow Limits and Boundaries of Affection which had been at any time set up, enlarge and draw it out to the utmost; and will have nothing less than the whole human Kind to be the proper and adequate Object of human Love? Not that the Gospel intends to loosen the Ties of Nature, or dissolve the Obligations arising from any of the Relations before-mentioned; but to fix them in their proper Order, and make them subordinate to that Obligation, which of all Others is the strongest and most natural. And very fitting it was, to rectify the Mistakes of those, who had so far inverted the Duties of Benevolence, as to degrade that, which next to the Love of God, is the highest of all: And it was well if some went not so far, as even to discard it.

<strong>But</strong> to return; How just, how fine an Explication of the Precept concerning the Love of our <em>Neighbour</em>, will you find couched under the Parable of the <em>Good Samaritan</em>? How beautiful appears the Action, how amiable the Character? In opposition to those who under<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">under- [stood] | stood</span></span>stood the Word <em>Neighbour</em> in too literal and narrow a Sense, our Saviour has here informed us, in a most lively and elegant Manner, that it is not to be restrained to Nearness of Situation, Familiarity, or Acquaintance; but that every human Creature, whatever be his Country, his Manners, his Religion, is to be reputed our <em>Neighbour</em>, and treated as such. Had a Foreigner of some remote Country been represented as the Person in Distress, or as the Person who relieved him, the finest Part of the Illustration had been lost. But the Object of Compassion is a <em>Jew</em>, and Succour is brought him by a <em>Samaritan</em>; who breaking though the National and Religious Prejudices that possessed, and mutually inflamed the Minds of those People against each other, runs to his Relief, and treats him with as much Humanity and Tenderness of Affection; as if he had been not only his Neighbour, but his Brother. The generous <em>Samaritan</em> considers him only as a Man in Distress: This was enough to excite his Compassion, and quicken his Care. All Animosities are laid asleep and forgotten, and he extends his Arms, and opens his Purse, for the Preservation of a Life that would otherwise have been lost. What a Pattern of true Benevolence is here! a Pattern that our Saviour has commanded us to imitate; and which you, Sir, must allow to be highly worthy of our Imitation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let me only observe further, by the way, that whoever through Party-Pre<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Party-Pre- [judice,] | judice,</span></span>judice, or Contrariety of Sentiment, stifles his Pity, or with-holds Relief, upon lesser Occasions than this; is so far only a Christian in Name. By such a Violation of Humanity, he doubly violates Christianity; which, I venture to assure you, is only Humanity sublimated and refined, and brought nearer to Perfection.

<strong>It</strong> has been objected against our Religion, that it takes so little Notice of <em>Friendships</em> as neither prescribing it, nor recommending it to Mens Choice and Approbation. But how unjust and groundless is this Objection? If Men reckon Friendship among their Privileges, yet why must they insist upon its being made a Duty? As a Privilege, is it not enough that it is permitted, and no where prohibited; or however, is it not sufficient, that Christ has countenanced it by his own Example, in taking one of his Disciples into his Bosom, and admitting him into a superior Share of his Familiarity and Love? But as to his Silence on this Subject, whoever rightly considers the Matter, will find little Reason to wonder at it. It was not his Intention to straighten Mens Affections, which perhaps were too much straightened already; but to widen and enlarge them. He did not aim to collect the Rays of Mens Love, and centre them upon single Objects, to the Prejudice of others; but rather strove to spread them far and wide, and make them as diffusive as possible. If he saw, as probably he did, that while Men warmed their <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">their [Breasts] | Breasts</span></span> Breasts with private Friendships, they grew in proportion cooler towards the Publick; was there any Reason to add Fuel to such a Flame? We may suppose him willing rather to check this Inclination, than to cultivate it. However, since he neither expressly approved nor condemned Friendship, this at least ought to content us. As his great Design was to promote universal Love and Charity, it may rather be wondered, that he should even connive at those particular Unions that might seem to interfere with it, than that he should pass them over in profound Silence.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But let me add, that how little soever he has thought fit to promote the Love of Friends, he has not only encouraged, but strictly enjoined, the Love of Enemies: A Duty but little known, and less practised before his Appearance. This shews, that he was more solicitous to supply Defects, than to prune away Redundancies. The Excellency of this Doctrine, the Agreeableness of it to uncorrupt Reason, and the Improvement it brings to Morality, are Subjects too copious to be insisted on at this Time.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> proceed therefore to observe, that as our Saviour did not enjoin Friendship, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he thought fit, as he safely might, to practise it himself; so the same may be said of a higher Attachment; I mean the Love of our <em>Country</em>, which has been so much and so often celebrated by other Moralists. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he has set Men a bright Example of it, I do not remember that he has given any express Precept <nobr>con<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">con- [cerning] | cerning</span></span>cerning</nobr> it. And the Reason I take to be the same in this Case as in the former. Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Love of his Country is doubtless a noble Affection; and if it were always regularly entertained and pursued, too much Countenance and Encouragement could never be given it. But if through Mens Imprudence and Folly, it contributes to weaken or dissolve higher Obligations; if it tends to contract their Minds, and alienate their Affections from the rest of Mankind, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>tis no longer praise worthy, but inglorious and detrimental.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If the <em>Jews</em> fell into such a Partiality; if they were disaffected to other Nations, and too fond of themselves; it must be owned they had a better Excuse than any other People could pretend to. They Were fenced about by Divine Laws, and a strong Partition was thrown up between them and the rest of the World; to prevent the Infection of Idolatry, which they were so prone to catch.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The <em>Greeks</em> and <em>Romans</em> had the same Partiality for them selves, without any such Pretence; and they covered it under the specious Names of Love, Piety, and Zeal. And in truth, it had very beneficial Effects at home. It worked them up to an unusual Pitch of Industry and Vigor, and produced many great Actions, and splendid Enterprizes. But after all, it had an ill Aspect on the Nations round about them, who were often great Sufferers by it. They were not only called, but considered as <em>Barbarians</em>, and almost looked upon as Creatures of another Species: Insulted upon every Occasion, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [treated] | treated</span></span> treated with great Cruelty and Scorn. That strong Passion for their Country, which possessed the Minds, and influenced the Counsels of those polite Republicks, made them frequently act like true <em>Barbarians</em>. It gave them a Right in their own Imaginations, to carry their Conquests, and extend their Dominions as far as they could: To invade the Territories of those who had never injured, never provoked them; and put Chains about the Necks of innocent Kings and Princes.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;See, Sir, the Effects of a misguided and preposterous Benevolence, and confess that it stood in need of those wise Regulations which Christianity brought along with it. Here we learn, that the Love of Mankind ought to be the ruling and predominant Affection; and by Consequence, that no other ought to interfere with it, but every thing give way to it. That whatever other Passions we entertain, we must take care to keep them subordinate to this, without which they can neither be laudable nor innocent. In short, we may, and ought to be as kind and serviceable as we can to our Neighbours, Friends, and Country; but our Affections must not stop there, nor be suffered to terminate on these Objects: For our Religion has commanded us to love all Men as Neighbours, as Countrymen, as Friends, as Brethren.

<strong>I</strong> need not extend this Observation to Mens Affection for their <em>Kindred</em>, which must needs be subject to the same Rules and Regulations.

For no Inclination, no Affection must be suffered to rival that supreme Principle, which you call the Love of Mankind, and we Christian Charity.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And how, Sir, can you retain any Prejudice against a Religion that holds forth such a sublime System of Morality? That contains Rules and Precepts, so excellent, and so divine? Examine the Wisdom of the Ancients; look through the Productions of all Ages; and if in any, or in all of them, a Scheme of Doctrine can be found, more just and glorious in itself, or more conducive to the Welfare and Perfection of Mankind; that better answers all wise and good Purposes, whether Human or Divine: Instead of recommending the Gospel to you any more, I shall earnestly intreat you to embrace That in the room of it, and adhere to it while you live.

<strong>When</strong> you have impartially considered the Principles of Christianity, let me desire you to cast your Eye upon that illustrious Example, that perfect Pattern of Virtue and all Goodness which our Saviour has set Men. Since you are so smitten (as well you may) with the Beauties of Virtue, and the Charms of Benevolence; behold here the highest Instance of it, that ever appeared among the Children of Men! Feast your Mind with the Contemplation of a Character that is entirely made up of Love; such Love, as no <em>Eye</em>, till then, had <em>seen</em>, nor <em>Ear</em> had <em>heard</em>, <em>neither had it entered into the Heart of Man to conceive</em>. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>conceive</em>. [Examine] |&nbsp;Examine</span></span> Examine with the most critical Exactness; mark its Features, and observe its Proportions; and tell me, if the Result be not perfect Beauty: If it be not infinitely amiable and excellent from first to last.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That the Son of God should veil his Glory, come down from Heaven, take our frail Nature upon him, and that under <em>the Form of a Servant</em>, making a low and obscure Appearance, and cloathing himself in the humblest Circumstances: That he should endure a sad Variety of Misery, and undergo all manner of Shame and Contempt, Contradiction and Calumny, Pain, and Persecution: That he should submit to be outraged, insulted and abused by the meanest of Mankind; bearing it with invincible Patience, Meekness, and Constancy; and striving at the same time to do all possible Good, even to those very Men, who thus maliciously and impiously treated him: In a Word, that he should live a laborious and wretched Life, and after that die a painful and ignominious Death: And all this for us Men, and for our Salvation; Rebels against Heaven, and Apostates from our Duty: This, I say, is a Scene of so astonishing a Nature, and every thing in it is so Great and Divine, as to be above the Power of Words, and the utmost Reach of Expression. Such a Sublimity of Goodness can no more be described, than it can be imitated.

<div class="unindented numbered">
<span class="dropcap"><span>W</span>HATEVER</span> has been, or may be said, in behalf of religious Rewards, as greatly useful in general, and in some Cases absolutely necessary; it must nevertheless be allowed and confessed, that, <em>c&aelig;teris Paribus</em>, the more disinterestedly any Agent acts, the more virtuous he is. Whatever shall be found in the foregoing Papers contrary to this Sentiment, I think myself obliged to retract it. I am fully convinced, that the highest Principle of a Moral Agent is a Love of Virtue for Virtue<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s sake; as his chief Merit is to pursue and practise it upon its own Account. The Perfection of Moral Goodness consists in being influenced solely by a Regard to Rectitude and right Reason, arid the intrinsic Fitness and Amiableness of such Actions as are conformable thereto. This, I humbly suppose, is the very Principle on which the Deity Himself acts; who indeed seems altogether incapable of being directed or determined by any other. For since He can have no Interest, no Prospect of Self-Advantage in doing good; He must needs be entirely disinterested in all his Dealings and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [Dispen-] | Dispensations.</span></span> Dispensations. He is <em>therefore</em> beneficent and gracious, <em>therefore</em> just, righteous, and holy; because it is intrinsically and eternally right and fit so to be.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>However</strong>, no just Occasion can be taken from hence of depreciating or neglecting other Rewards which both Reason and Revelation set before us. Man is not capable of so perfect and exalted a Course of Virtue as we are here speaking of; at least, not in his present Condition, Considering the Indigence and Infirmity of his Nature, some Parts of his Duty are really impracticable on the Foot of Disinterest. I mean, that he may be, and often is so circumstanced, that, excluding all Hopes of Recompence, Virtue shall become uneligible to him. Deep Distress will naturally swallow up all other Perceptions, or render him in capable of attending to them. Besides, a <em>sensible</em> Agent can no more be indifferent to <em>Happiness</em> than a <em>moral</em> Agent can be indifferent to <em>Rectitude</em>. They must therefore be some way reconciled, and rendered consistent; which in many Cases they cannot possibly be, without the Supposition and Influence of Future Rewards, as I have endeavoured to prove in the foregoing Letter. If a Man was in Possession of all his natural Desires, enjoying his proper Good, and fixed above the Reach of Sufferings; it would then indeed be perfectly reasonable, and therefore his indispensible Duty, to embrace Virtue for its own Sake. But since he is, on the contrary, obnoxious to Evil and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [Misery,] | Misery,</span></span> Misery, and continually wanting Supplies of Good; his Aims and Endeavours must, and will be directed accordingly. Happiness being desireable in itself, and without Reference to any further End; he cannot in Reason abandon or give it up. He may sacrifice a present: Good to a future one; and if the latter be of much greater Value than the former, he Cannot answer it to himself if he does not; But to require of him a Resignation of the Whole, is to require him to renounce, or counter-act the Principles of his own Nature; which unavoidably engage him in the Quest of <em>Happiness</em>, at the same time that, they incline him to the Pursuit of <em>Virtue</em>. Whoever therefore sets these great Objects at Variance, does, in Effect, and, by a natural Consequence, undermine both. Whatever may sometimes happen here, Providence permitting it for wise Ends; most assuredly an everlasting Connexion will be found or fixed between them hereafter. This can neither be denied, nor doubted of by any one, who believes that the Administration of the World is in the Hands of infinite Wisdom.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> would further observe, that the Desire of Immortality so deeply grafted in our Minds, may be greatly increased and strengthened by a mere Affection for Virtue. If we lose our Existence, we lose along with it all Opportunities of doing good, not only to our selves, but to our Fellow-Creatures. A Future State therefore must be very desirable on a <em>Moral</em> Account, as well as a <em>Natural</em>, as it makes room for the continued Exercise and Improve<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Improve- [ment] | ment</span></span>ment of Virtue. To aim even at a perpetual Enjoyment of Virtue, is not only innocent and justifiable, but really meritorious. Such an Intention is abundantly sufficient to consecrate our Views and Hopes of Immortality, and renders us in some measure disinterested, even in the Pursuit of our highest Interest.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Virtue</em> and <em>Happiness</em>, however they may happen to be separated here, will hereafter not only be united, but intimately mixed. They will run into each other, and be almost undistinguishable. Or, in other Words, the several Streams of Benevolence, Gratitude, and Devotion, that will be continually flowing and increasing; will form themselves into <em>Rivers of Pleasures</em>, and run for ever at God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Right Hand.

<strong>But</strong> to return; if we consider <em>Virtue</em> or Moral Rectitude in it self, as an eternal<em> Rule of Action</em> to intelligent Beings, necessarily arising from the Natures of Things, its own Dignity and Beauty must, in all ordinary Cases, re commend it to uncorrupted Minds. But considered as <em>Religion</em>, or the Will and Command of the Supreme Legislator, it must be enforced by the Sanctions of <em>Rewards</em> and <em>Punishments</em>; and those Sanctions are the more requisite in proportion to the Depravity of Mankind. The Bulk of our Species are too corrupt to be influenced or wrought upon by the intrinsick Worth and Excellence of Virtue. But few, in comparison, are such Proficients, as to be capable of being drawn by the fine intellectual Cords of Moral Beauty, Order, and Proportion. A vast Majority must be driven by Authority, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Authority, [and] | and</span></span> and managed by the Springs of Hope and Fear. And if this be the true State of Mankind, as must be acknowledged; whoever attempts to take off Men<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Thoughts and Regards from the Sanctions of Religion, and to fix them entirely on the natural Charms of Virtue; will, in all Probability, do much more Hurt than Good. A great Part of the World, in respect of their Duty, want Discipline as much as Children; and without Promises or Menaces, will not be prevailed upon, or even moved. Some must be listed into the Cause of Virtue by Rewards, and Prospects of Interest; others impressed by Threats and Sufferings. When they are thus allured or awed, into the Service of Religion, they will afterwards find Reason to persist freely in it, and learn to act both religiously and virtuously upon higher and nobler Motives. However, since the Generality of Men can, only be considered as in an Infant-State of Virtue; it must be unseasonable and preposterous, to endeavour to work upon them, wholly or chiefly, by those manly Inducements, and refined Considerations before-mentioned. Had Men been as well disposed to the Knowledge and Practice of their Duty, as they might and ought to have been, Revelation would have been, at least in some measure, needless. But the Experience of all Ages has made it manifest, that the Rectitude and Beauty of Virtue have, comparatively, but small Influence on Mankind; whose Irregularities and Disorders hinder their Operation, and require <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">require [require] | more</span></span> more efficacious Principles.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short, the Question is not, which Motives are the purest, and most sublime; but, which are most useful, and most effectual, to prevail with degenerate Man, and accomplish his Reformation. If human Virtue had been advanced to such a Height, as to want only its Finishing and Perfection; it would have been very proper, and very seasonable to inculcate the Principle of Disinterest; to recommend Rectitude for its own sake, and set forth Right Reason in all its Glory. But, alas! the far greater Part of the World, instead of being perfected in their Duty, want to be made Converts to it: and whether this Point is more likely to be gained by the mere Fitness and Beauty of Virtue, or the Sanctions of Religion, let the Reader judge.

<div class="unindented numbered">
<span class="dropcap"><span>T</span>HE</span> ingenious Author of the <em>Enquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</em>, has written both his Books with so good a Design, is every where so instructive or entertaining, and discovers upon all Occasions such a Fund of good Nature, as well as good Sense, that I find myself much more inclined to join with the Publick in his just Praise, than offer any Objections against his Performance. And indeed it is not without Pain, that I attempt to point out some Par<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Par- [ticulars,] | ticulars,</span></span>ticulars, wherein I apprehend he has erred. I should scarce content myself with the old Excuse of <em>magis amica Veritas</em>, if the Mistakes which I think he has committed, did not appear to be of the utmost Consequence; if they did not lie at the Foundations of Morality, and, like Failures in Ground-work, affect the whole Building.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To enquire what it is that originally constitutes <em>Virtue</em> or <em>Moral Goodness</em>, and whence arises that universal <em>Approbation</em> which it meets with from rational Beings, are undoubtedly Speculations of very great Moment: It may be justly questioned, whether any more important can enter into the Mind of Man. The deeper we search into the Nature of Virtue, if we search with Success, the more excellent and more amiable we shall find it. We should therefore consider this Matter with our utmost Attention, and carefully examine such Questions as may arise concerning it. Our Author is so sensible of this, that I am confident it will give him no Disturbance, to find any of his Sentiments on this Subject examined, or even opposed, provided it be done seriously, and with that Decency and Moderation of which he has set so good an Example.

<strong>Among</strong> the several Notions of Morality which have been advanced, our Author observes<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that <em>there are two Opinions entirely opposite,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;both intelligible, each consistent with itself. That the one seems not to represent</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>represent</em> [<em>human</em>] | <em>human</em></span></span> <em>human Nature as it is, and that the other seems to do it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The former of these Opinions is, that all Actions flow from the Prospect of private Happiness</em>, of some kind or other,<em> as the sole Motive of Election. That in like manner, what determines any Agent to approve his own Action, is its Tendency to his private Happiness, and that the Approbation of the Action of another, is from an Opinion of its Tendency to the Happiness of the Approver, either immediately or more remotely.</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>This</strong> Scheme our Author with great Reason rejects, as dishonourable to human Nature, and injurious to the Cause of Virtue. He justly observes, that <em>it can never account for the principal Actions of human Life; such as the Offices of Friendship, Gratitude, natural Affection, Generosity, publick Spirit, Compassion</em>. And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> I cannot so far agree with him, as to conclude that no Actions can be morally good, which are solely directed to private Interest; yet I think it very evident that such a Supposition is utterly inconsistent with <em>social</em> Virtue, as he has clearly and incontestably proved.

<strong>And</strong> this is in part the other Opinion, which he lays down in Opposition to the former. He represents it thus, in one of the Pages referred to before, viz. <em>That we have not only Self-Love, but benevolent Affections also towards others in various Degrees, making us desire their Happiness as an ultimate End, without any View to private Happiness. That we</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>we</em> [<em>aveh</em>] | <em>have</em></span></span> <em>have a moral Sense, or Determination of our Mind, to approve every kind of Affection either in ourselves or others; and all publickly useful Actions, which we imagine do flow from such Affection, without our having a View to our private Happiness in our Approbation of these Actions</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In order to apprehand [sic] rightly our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Scheme, it will be necessary to compare this Passage with what he has laid down elsewhere.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Every Action</em>, says he, <em>which we apprehend as morally good or evil, is always supposed to sow from some Affection towards</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Rational Agents. And whatever we call Virtue or Vice, is either some such Affection, or some Action consequent upon it</em>. He tells us in another<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Place, that <em>the true Spring of Virtue is some Determination of our Nature to study the Good of others, or some Instinct&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;which influences us to the Love of others, as the moral Sense determines us to approve the Actions which stow from this hove in ourselves or others</em>.

<strong>Having</strong> given an Account of these two opposite Opinions, he proceeds to take Notice of other different Ideas of Virtue, as I conceive them to be; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he considers them only as<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> other Ways of speaking, which seems to signify something different.

<strong>That</strong> the Author of Nature has planted in our Minds <em>benevolent Affections towards others</em>, cannot be denied without contradicting Experience, and falsifying our own Perceptions. Whoever carefully reflects on what passes within his own Breast, may soon be convinced of this Truth, and even feel the Evidences of it. Nor can it be doubted but these <em>Affections</em> were given us in order to engage, assist and quicken us in a Course of virtuous Actions. They may be looked upon as Auxiliaries, aiding us in our Duty, and supporting and seconding our Reason and Reflection.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But from the Passages I have produced, and others of the like Nature, it plainly appears that our Author does not consider this <em>natural Affection</em> or <em>Instinct</em>, merely as a Help or Incentive to Virtue, but as the true Ground and Foundation of it. He makes Virtue entirely to consist in it, or flow from it.

<strong>I</strong> must confess myself prejudiced, in some measure, against this Notion, and cannot forbear expressing my Hopes that it will not prove to be just. If the two <em>Instincts</em> of <em>Affection</em> and <em>moral Sense</em> be the only Pillars on which moral Goodness rests, how secure it may stand I know not, but am afraid its Honour, its Dignity, its Beauty will suffer in the Eyes of a great Part of <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">of [the] | the</span></span> the rational World. I am as unwilling, as our Author can be, that <em>Virtue should be looked upon as wholly artificial</em>. Let it by all means be represented as <em>Natural</em> to us; let it take its Rise, and flow unalterably from the Nature of Men and Things, and then it will appear not only <em>natural</em> but <em>necessary</em>.

<em>First</em> Place, It seems an insuperable Difficulty in our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Scheme, that Virtue appears in it to be of an arbitrary and positive Nature, as entirely depending upon <em>Instincts</em>, that might originally have been otherwise, or even contrary to what they now are, and may at any time be altered or inverted, if the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"> the [Creator] | Creator</span></span> Creator pleases. If our Affections constitute the <em>Honestum</em> of a Morality, and do not presuppose it; it is natural to ask, What it was that determined the Deity to plant in us these Affections rather than any other? This our Author answers by supposing a certain<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Disposition essential to the Deity, corresponding to the Affections he has given us</em>. As he also supposes something <em>analogous</em> in the Deity <em>to our moral Sense</em>. By such a <em>Disposition</em> he imagines the Deity would naturally be inclined to give us the <em>kind Affections</em> in Preference to any other. I ask then further, Is such a <em>Disposition</em> a Perfection in the Deity, or is it not? Is it better than a contrary, or than any other Disposition would have been; more worthy of his Nature, and more agreeable to his other Perfections? If it be not, let us not presume to ascribe it to Him. Whatever is in the Deity must be absolutely good, and <em>sui generis</em> the very best. On the other Hand, if this Disposition be absolutely good, and really better than any other, then the Question will be, why, and upon what Account it is so? Whatever shall be assigned as the Ground or Reason of that Goodness or Betterness, that we may securely pitch upon, as a proper Foundation for Virtue. If no Reason can be given why the Deity should be <em>benevolently disposed</em>, and yet we suppose him to be so; will it not follow, that he is influenced and acted by a blind unaccountable Impulse?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In Matters perfectly indifferent, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">indifferent, [it] | it</span></span> it is needless and absurd to have recourse to Mr. <em>Leibnitz</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Principle of a sufficient Reason</em>; and where several Means equally conduce to a proposed End, it is certainly indifferent which of them are chosen. But it can never be thought an indifferent Matter how the Deity is <em>disposed</em> or <em>affected</em> towards his Creatures. Either therefore it must be concluded, that he is determined by the Reason of the Thing, and that this is the Ground of his Benevolence; or else it must be said, that such a Disposition is <em>necessary</em> in the Deity: If the latter, I ask, In what Sense is it necessary? A <em>moral Necessity</em> is manifestly nothing to the Purpose; and if a <em>physical</em> or natural <em>Necessity</em> be meant, that is utterly inconsistent with our Ideas of Goodness. As far as any Acts of Kindness are Unchosen and unavoidable, so far they are no Kindness at all, neither infer they any Obligation. But of this more afterwards.

<strong>Our</strong> Author, in his <em>Enquiry into the original Idea of Virtue</em>, has made the following Observation,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>That our first Ideas of moral Good depend not on Laws, may plainly appear from our constant Enquiries into the Justice of Laws themselves; and that not only of human Laws, but also of the Divine. What else can be the Meaning of that universal Opinion, that the Laws of God are just, and holy, and good?</em> Very right. But I wonder much this Sentiment should not have led the Author to the true original Idea of moral Goodness. For <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">For [after] | after</span></span> after we have made such Enquiries, do we find Reason to conclude that any <em>Laws</em> are good, merely from their being conformable to the <em>Affections</em> of the Legislator? And in respect of the divine Laws, what is it that convinces us that they are <em>just</em>, and <em>holy</em>, and <em>good</em>? Is it their Conformity to a certain <em>Disposition</em> which we suppose in the Deity? On the contrary, is it not a Perception of the intrinsick Reasonableness of them, and their Tendency to the Publick Good? If we impartially consult our Ideas, I am persuaded we shall find that moral Goodness no more depends originally on <em>Affections</em> and <em>Dispositions</em>, than it does on <em>Laws</em>; and that there is something in Actions, absolutely good, antecedent to both.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
2. <strong>Another</strong> Objection to out Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Account of moral Good, is, that according thereto, if God had not framed our Natures with such a Propensity, and given us this benevolent Instinct, we should have been altogether incapable of Virtue; and notwithstanding Intelligence, Reason, and Liberty, it would have been out of our Power to perform one Action in any Degree morally good. It is evident that this is a direct Consequence of his Notion; and how a Notion should be true, that labours under such a Consequence as this, I cannot understand. Let it be supposed, that we had been formed destitute of <em>natural Affection</em>; and more particularly, that we found in our Hearts no kind Instinct towards our Benefactors: <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Benefactors: [Would] | Would</span></span> Would <em>Gratitude</em>, upon this Supposition, have been absolutely out of our Power? Might we not nevertheless, by the Help of Reason and Reflection, discover ourselves to be under Obligations, and that we ought to return good Offices or Thanks, according to our Abilities? If we did not, certainly it would be owing to great Inadvertency and Absence of Thought.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Or, supposing us void of <em>natural Compassion</em>, as well as <em>Benevolence</em>; might we not possibly be induced to attempt the Relief of a Person in Distress, merely from the <em>Reason</em> of the Thing, and the <em>Rectitude</em> of the Action? Might we not, by considering the Nature of the Case, and the Circumstances of the Sufferer, perceive some Fitness, some Reasonableness in an Act of Succour? Might not some such Maxim as that of doing as we would be done unto, offer itself to our Minds, and prevail with us to stretch out a helping Hand upon such an Occasion? In short, if we made any Use of our Understandings, they would not fail, I think, to discover our Duty in such a Case. Nay, they would prompt us to undertake it, and condemn us if we omitted it. He who now declines such an Office, incurs the Imputation of Inhumanity and Cruelty. And even upon the Supposition I am speaking of, who would scruple to pronounce him unreasonable and unjust? Considering the Frailties and Thoughtlessness of Mankind, it is but too manifest that we stand in need of Instincts and Inclinations to prompt us to what is good, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [stimulate] | stimulate</span></span> stimulate us to our Duty: and good Reason there was, why we would not be trusted to ourselves, and the Dictates of our Reason, without them. But still such Virtues would surely have been practicable, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they might, have been more practised.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whoever is led by Instinct to the Performance of a good Action, follows the Biass of his Nature. What shall we say then of him who performs the same Action in Obedience to the Reason of his own Mind? Is it not as <em>natural</em> for a <em>reasonable</em> Creature to act <em>reasonably</em>, as for an <em>affectionate</em> one to act <em>affectionately</em>? It should be more so; because tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> both Principles are natural, yet the former is greatly superior, as being of a nobler and sublimer kind. To represent a rational Agent as incapable of performing or approving Actions morally good, without presupposing certain Instincts, seems to me inverting the Frame of our Nature, and transferring the Supremacy from the highest Principle to the lowest.

</aside>
3. <strong>Another</strong> Difficulty in our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Scheme is, that it seems to expose him to the Necessity of allowing some Degree of Virtue to <em>Brutes</em>, when in describing a moral Action, he directs and confines our Affections to <em>rational</em> Objects. This Limitation, as I before took notice, appears to have been only casual, for as much as in other Places, he takes in all <em>sensitive</em> Beings. And indeed, there is no Reason to doubt, but Brutes, as they are capable of being treated by us either mercifully or cruelly, may <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">may [be] | be</span></span> be the <em>Objects</em> either of Virtue or Vice. But the present Question is, whether, according to our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Account of moral Good, they are not also in some measure <em>Subjects</em> of Virtue? For if Virtue be only kind <em>Instincts</em>, or <em>Affections</em>, or <em>Actions consequent upon them</em>, how shall we be able to disprove or deny the Virtue of Brutes? They pursue the Instincts and Impulses of Nature, more steadily and regularly than Men; they shew<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Affection to their respective Kinds, and a strong Degree of Love and Tenderness towards their Off-spring. And if a Perception, or a Consciousness of the Reasonableness of Actions, be not required to constitute those Actions virtuous, what is there wanting to render many of theirs truly such? If it be alledged that they know not what they do, and that they are neither capable of intending Good, nor sensible of any Effects of their Love: my Answer is, that they have kind Affections and suitable Actions; which is our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Idea of Virtue: Besides, I cannot allow all those Suppositions to pass for Facts, till some Proof appear. In the mean while, it seems to me that these Creatures Incapacity for Morals, is to be ascribed chiefly, and perhaps wholly, to their utter Ignorance of the Reasons and Relations of Things: from whence it may be justly concluded, that whatever Ideas <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ideas [they] | they</span></span> they may have of <em>natural</em> Good, they can have none of <em>moral</em>.

</aside>
4. <strong>Another</strong> Argument against our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Origin of Virtue, is, that if Virtue consist in kind Affections, then the stronger those Affections, the greater the Virtue. I presume this Consequence is very clear, and yet, if I mistake not, it is both contrary to Fact, and to our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s own Declarations. He tells us,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that <em>in equal Moments of Good produced by two Agents, when one acts from a general Benevolence, the other from a nearer Tye, there is greater Virtue in the Agent who produces greater good from the weaker Attachment.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Thus in co-operating with Gratitude, natural Affection, or Friendship, we evidence less Virtue in any given Moment of Good produced, than in equally important Actions of general Benevolence</em>. From hence I think it follows, that if <em>equal Good</em> were supposed to be <em>produced by an Agent</em>, without any Affection or <em>Attachment</em> at all, his <em>Virtue</em> would still be <em>greater</em> in the same Proportion. How then would that be the true Ground or Principle of Virtue, by the total Absence of which Virtue is mightily increased, and which lessens it when present, in proportion to the Degree of its own Strength and Influence? How to reconcile the foregoing Passage with the Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Idea of Virtue, I must confess myself at a loss. However, the Passage seems to me to contain nothing but what is evidently true. An Act of Kindness <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Kindness [done] | done</span></span> done to a <em>Child</em> or a dear <em>Friend</em>, is certainly less Virtue than doing the same to a <em>Stranger</em>, And what can be the Reason of it? Are not the Actions equally reasonable? Or, rather, is not the former more reasonable than the latter? Why then less virtuous? Because the Impulse is so strong as to supersede Reflection, and over-rule, in a great measure, the Freedom of Choice. To be determined to the doing a good Action merely by the Reason and Right of the Thing, is genuine Goodness; this is the purest and most perfect Virtue of which any Agent is capable. As far as we are influenced by Instincts and Affections, so much is to be discounted in the Estimate of our Beneficence; as I shall soon have further Occasion to observe. On the other hand, the stronger the Instinct, the more vicious is the Violation of it, as our Author takes notice. A barbarous Action committed against a Child or a Friend, is vastly more criminal than against a Stranger; as in this Case a Man breaks through much stronger Ties and Obligations, and shamefully counter-acts both Reason and Affection in their utmost Force.

</aside>
<strong>But</strong> to proceed; Let us hear what Reason our Author gives for <em>those Actions appearing less amiable, which flow from the nearer Attachments of Nature</em>. He tells us,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> the Reason is plainly this, <em>These strong Instincts are by Nature limited to small Numbers of Mankind</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As I do not apprehend this to be the right <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">right [Reason,] | Reason,</span></span> Reason, so neither do I think in affords any Solution of the forementioned Difficulty; for however a general Affection may be preferable to a limited and partial one, yet certainly, according to our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Scheme, the Degree of an Agent<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Virtue must depend upon the <em>Strength</em> of his Affections, as well as the <em>Extent</em> and Diffusiveness of them. If Virtue consists only in Affection and the Effects it produces, this Consequence is unavoidable.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Supposing then that Men had the same <em>natural Affection</em> for their whole <em>Species</em>, that they have now for their <em>Off-spring</em>, I ask, Whether would this <em>increase</em> or <em>diminish</em> the Virtue and Merit of their goodOffices? [sic] If it be said, that it would <em>diminish</em> the Virtue of them, how is that to be reconciled with our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Opinion, who derives all Virtue from Affection, and makes it entirely consist in it? If it be said that it would <em>increase</em> it, how is that consistent either with the fore-cited Passages, or the Truth of the Case? Not with those Passages, because Actions are there represented as <em>less virtuous</em>, when flowing from <em>near Attachments</em> or strong Affections: Not with the Truth of the Case, because upon this Supposition, universal Kindness would be almost unavoidable, while little or no room was left for the Influence of Reason.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And this I take to be the true Cause why parental Kindness is less meritorious and less virtuous than other Species of Benevolence; for in this Case, the Instincts and Impulses of Nature are generally so strong as to lay a kind <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">kind [of] | of</span></span> of a Constraint upon Parents, and engage them almost irresistably in a Series of good Offices. Their Virtue therefore is diminished in proportion to the Strength of this natural Bias, and the Weight that is laid upon their Wills; and so it would be in respect of <em>general Benevolence</em>, upon the foregoing Supposition. On the contrary, supposing the &sigma;&tau;&omicron;&rho;&gamma;&#942;, or <em>natural Affection</em> suspended, or taken off, the Virtue of those Parents who nevertheless discharged their Duty, would be exceedingly increased.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However, we cannot but acknowledge and admire the Wisdom and Goodness of the Creator, in not trusting to the Reflection of frail Man for the Performance of so necessary a Duty. It is much better that the Balance of natural Affection be too strong, as we commonly find it is, than that helpless Infants should be committed to the Care of <em>unaffectionate</em> Parents.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return; In order to be satisfied of the Truth of the foregoing Observation, let us imagine the Head of some numerous Family, large enough for a little Colony, carrying them away with him into some remote and desolate Island, and there forming a petty Principality; his Care in enacting good Laws, and executing them faithfully and prudently, his indefatigable Endeavours to promote the Welfare of his Descendants, and his governing them with all the Mildness, Gentleness and Clemency, that were consistent with an orderly Administration, would doubtless be laudable and virtuous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">virtuous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; [But] | But</span></span>But let us imagine another Legislator, presiding over an equal Number of People, where there was no such <em>near Attachments</em> of Nature, no Tye of Consanguinity, and yet ruling with equal Care, Prudence, Gentleness and Moderation; whether of these Characters would ap pear more amiable and deserving? Whether should we more approve and admire? In the former Case, a great Share of the Merit would be placed to the Account of <em>natural Affection</em>, commonly so called. In the latter, excepting the <em>weaker Attachment</em> of common <em>Humanity</em>, we discover nothing but pure Virtue, and a Sense of Honour and Duty; for as to external Motives, I suppose them equal in both Cases.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And if instead of small Governments, large and populous Kingdoms could have been supposed thus circumstantiated, the different Merit of the Legislators would still have appeared in the same Light. From whence we may justly conclude, that the true Reason why <em>parental</em> or any other <em>Benevolence</em>, that flows from the <em>near Attachments</em> of Nature, appear less amiable and virtuous, is not <em>its being limited to small Numbers of Mankind</em>, as our Author has represented it. What appears to me the just and right Way of accounting for it has been already observed, and need not here be repeated.

5. <em>Lastly</em>, <strong>It</strong> may deserve to be considered (though I have touched upon it already) how much Virtue is depreciated and dishonoured by so ignoble an Original. In our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Scheme <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Scheme [it] | it</span></span> it is resolved ultimately into mere <em>Instinct</em>, and made to consist in it; and even that universal Approbation which it meets with from intelligent Creatures, is ascribed to a certain <em>Sense</em>, and made to depend wholly on it. Now if <em>Virtue</em> and the <em>Approbation</em> of Virtue, be merely <em>instinctive</em>, we must certainly think less highly and less honourably of it, than we should do if we looked upon it as <em>rational</em>; for I suppose it will readily be allowed, that <em>Reason</em> is the nobler Principle: It is therefore to be wished that it may be found to have the first and chief Place in the <em>original Idea of Virtue</em>, and the Exclusion of it must, I think, be a Disparagement to both.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Some will not allow</em>, our Author tells us,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>any Merit in Action flowing from kind Instincts, the Operation of which, they say, is not voluntary but necessary</em>. Has our Author any where denied their operating in this Manner? Or has he attempted to shew that they may produce meritorious Actions, notwithstanding such a Manner of Operation? I cannot find that he has done either; and indeed it seems utterly impossible to reconcile <em>Virtue</em> with any kind of <em>Necessity</em>, As far as any Actions spring from a necessary Principle, so far they must be, in a moral Sense, worthless. If it be said that Instincts do not <em>force</em> the Mind, but only <em>incline</em> it; I answer, that as much Room as they leave for the Use of Liberty and the Exercise of Reason, so much Room they leave for Virtue; but then this Virtue consists in a <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">a [<em>rational</em>] | <em>rational</em></span></span> <em>rational Determination</em>, and not in a blind Pursuit of the <em>Instinct</em>. What he objects to this will be considered in its proper Place; in the mean time, to his Query concerning the Meaning of the Words <em>Merit</em> or <em>Praise-worthiness</em>; I answer, that <em>they denote the Quality in Actions which</em> not only <em>gains the Approbation of the Observer</em>, but which also <em>deserves</em> or is <em>worthy</em> of it.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Approbation</em> does not constitute <em>Merit</em>, but is produced by it; is not the Cause of it, but the Effect. An Agent might be meritorious, though it were in the Power of all other Beings to with-hold their Approbation, he might deserve their Praise, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we suppose him at the same Time under an universal Censure. Notwithstanding all that our Author has alledged in behalf of <em>Instincts</em>, I think it appears, even from what has been already said, that they are so far from constituting <em>Virtue</em> or moral Goodness, that, other Things being equal, we always account those Actions most virtuous which have the least Dependance upon Instincts; and tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> in some Sense we approve of those Actions which flow from Instincts, yet there are others which we approve much more, as flowing from a superior Principle, and meriting our Approbation in themselves, and upon their own account.

<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Hoc decorum quidem est totum cum virtute confusum, sed mente & cogitatione distinguitur. <strong>Cic</strong>. ibid.</span>
<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Letter in the <em>London-Journal</em>. Numb. 450.</span>
<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Since the first Publication of these Papers, I have been convinced, that all Beauty, whether Moral or Natural, is to be reckoned and reputed as a Species of absolute Truth; as resulting from, or consisting in, the necessary Relations and unchangeable Congruities of Ideas: and, by Consequence, that in order to the Perception of Beauty, no other Power need to be supposed, than what is merely intellectual. And as to the Diversity of Perceptions above-mentioned, the natural or accidental Differences of Mens Understandings seem now to me sufficient to account for it.</span>
</aside>
<strong>I</strong> shall now proceed to consider the other of the two Instincts which our Author has offered for the Support of Morality, <em>viz</em>. The <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">The [<em>moral</em>] | <em>moral</span></span></em><em>moral Sense</em>, the Object of which seems to me not sufficiently specified.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Virtue</em>, or moral Goodness, may be considered either under the Notion of<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Pulchrum</em> or <em>Honestum</em>. As to the <em>Pulchrum</em> or <em>Beauty</em> of Virtue, it seems to me somewhat doubtful and difficult to determine, whether the <em>Understanding</em> alone be sufficient for the Perception of it, or whether it be not necessary to suppose some distinct Power superadded for that Purpose. It should seem indeed, as an ingenious Writer has observed,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that our Faculty of Understanding is of itself sufficient for such a Perception, that the <em>Beauty</em> of Virtue inseparably and necessarily adheres to the <em>Ideas</em> themselves, which <em>whenever presented to the Mind, appear invariably the same</em>, always amiable and always beautiful. But when I consider, what perhaps is the Case in fact, that Perceptions of the <em>Pulchrum</em> and of the <em>Honestum</em>, seem not equally universal, or if universal, yet in very different Degrees; that while every rational Creature clearly and uniformly perceives, in all ordinary Cases, what is <em>fit</em>, and <em>just</em>, and <em>right</em>; many Men have little or no Perception of that <em>Beauty</em> in Actions, with which others are wonderfully charmed: And when I further consider, that some Actions appear to all Men more <em>beautiful</em> than others, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> equally <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em>; as in the Case of <em>Social</em> and <em>Self-Duties</em>; I find myself obliged <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">obliged [to] | to</span></span> to suspend, and to wait for further Evidence.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Especially in respect of the <em>Pleasure</em> resulting from such Perceptions. For however <em>Ideas</em>, <em>beautiful</em> in themselves, may be <em>seen</em> by the Understanding, yet Pleasure is not seen, but <em>felt</em>; and therefore seems to be an Object of some other Faculty than that which we are used to consider as merely <em>visive</em>. If the purest Pleasures be <em>Sensations</em>, of some kind or other; the Mind in receiving them, must be looked upon, not as <em>intelligent</em>, but <em>sensible</em>. And indeed, <em>Sensibility</em> seems to be as distinct from the <em>Understanding</em>, as the <em>Understanding</em> is from the <em>Will</em>. We should not therefore confound them in our Conceptions.

<strong>But</strong> this is a Speculation somewhat foreign to my present Purpose. It was not the <em>Beauty of Virtue</em>, or the <em>Pleasure</em> arising from the Perception of it, that I proposed to enquire into. My Intention was only to consider the Nature, and search for the Origin of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>. For the Perception of this, I presume it will appear, that the Faculty of Understanding is altogether sufficient, without the Intervention of our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Moral Sense</em>. But before I enter into this Matter, it may be pro<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">pro- [per] | per</span></span>per to consider how improbable it is, that other Perceptions of <em>Right</em> and <em>Wrong</em>, and the <em>Approbation</em> or <em>Disapprobation</em> consequent thereupon, should depend on such a <em>Sense</em>, or <em>Instinct</em>, as he has advanced for that purpose. And here I shall only need to observe, that this Opinion is liable to the very same Objections, and labours under the same Difficulties with the former.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Thus, as deriving Virtue merely from natural <em>Affection</em>, implies it to be of an arbitrary and changeable Nature; our judging and approving of it by a <em>Moral Sense</em> implies the same: Forasmuch as this <em>Sense</em>, as well as that <em>Affection</em>, might possibly have been quite contrary to what it is at present; or may be altered at any Time hereafter. Accordingly our Author grants,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>There is nothing in this surpassing the Natural Power of the Deity</em>. But I humbly apprehend he is mistaken; and that it is no more in the Power of the Deity to make rational Beings <em>approve of Ingratitude</em>, <em>Perfidiousness</em>, &c. than it is in his Power to make them conclude, <em>that a Part of any thing is equal to the Whole</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In like manner, as according to our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Scheme, we should have been utterly incapable of <em>Virtue</em> without <em>Natural Affection</em>; so without a <em>Moral Sense</em>, we could never have <em>approved</em> of it; nor ever have had any Idea at all of Moral Goodness; so that in this respect, our Understandings would have been entirely useless. As if intelligent Creatures could nor, as such, perceive the most obvious Relations, and judge <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">judge [of] | of</span></span> of a plain <em>Action</em>, as well as a plain <em>Truth!</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Again, as it seems to follow from our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Idea of Virtue, that Brutes may be in some degree capable of practising it; so upon the same Supposition of a <em>moral Sense</em>, why may they not, in some measure, <em>approve</em> of such a Practice? It is not to be doubted but they are sensible of Pleasure, in the Exercise of their natural Affections. Supposing them then endued with a <em>Moral</em> Sense, or something corresponding thereto, why might they not see with Complacency others of their own Species exercising and exerting the same Affections? And indeed, if the Reasons and Relations of Things are out of the Question, and this <em>moral Sense</em> means no more than a natural Determination to receive agreeable or disagreeable Ideas of certain Actions; I think it will be very difficult to prove Brutes incapable of such a Sense.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Thus again, as I think it follows from our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Notion, that the stronger Mens <em>Affections</em> are, the greater must be their <em>Virtue</em>; so it may be concluded, that the stronger and quicker their <em>moral Sense</em> is, the higher must their <em>Approbation</em> of virtuous Actions rise. Let the Perceptions of <em>Beauty</em>, and the <em>Pleasure</em> which attends them, be supposed as different and various as the Author thinks fit. But to make the <em>Rectitude</em> of moral Actions dependant upon <em>Instinct</em>, and in proportion to the Warmth and Strength of the <em>moral Sense</em>, rise and fall like Spirits in a Thermometer, is depreciating the most sacred Thing in the World, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">World, [and] | and</span></span> and almost exposing it to Ridicule. I believe no Man living is further from such an Intention than our Author: But I am obliged to examine his Opinion as if it was not his. If what I have now observed be not a real Consequence from it, I must be answerable for the Mistake: But if it be, as I presume it is, it seems heavy enough to sink any Opinion in the World. It might as well be said, that eternal and necessary Truths may be altered and diversified, encreased or lessened by the Difference of Mens Understandings; as that Virtue or Moral Rectitude should be capable of such a Variation. It can receive no Change, no Alteration any way, much less in consequence of a <em>Sense</em> or an <em>Instinct</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Lastly, as I took notice how Virtue was dishonoured by so ignoble an Original as that of Instinct, so the same Observation may be applied to the Notion of a <em>moral Sense</em>, with this Addition, that at the same time that it depreciates Virtue, it also debases the Faculty of Reason: The Former it does by ascribing to a blind Impulse that Approbation which Virtue eternally claims in its own Right; the Latter by representing our Understandings as incapable, and as insufficient of themselves, to judge and approve of it. And what can be more disparaging to Reason, than to deny it a Power of distinguishing, in the most ordinary Cases, between Right and Wrong, Good and Evil! Suppose a Man deprived of what our Author calls the <em>moral Sense</em>; and according to his Hypothesis, whatever Reason and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [Philosophy] | Philosophy</span></span> Philosophy the Man may be possessed of, the Characters of <em>Antoninus</em> and <em>Caligula</em>, of <em>Socrates</em> and <em>Apicius</em>, shall appear to him in the same Light, and their Conduct equally praise-worthy, or rather equally indifferent: Than which I cannot easily imagine a more shocking Absurdity.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Thus</strong> I think it appears that our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Opinions concerning the two Instincts of <em>Affection</em> and <em>moral Sense</em>, stand equally exposed to the same Objections. From whence we may observe how nicely they are matched, and how exactly they tally to each other.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let us then seek out for some <em>other Original of our Ideas</em>, and enquire whether <em>Virtue</em> or <em>moral Goodness</em> do not stand on a surer and nobler Foundation. Perhaps we may find it independent of all <em>Instincts</em>, necessarily fixed, and immoveably rooted in the Nature of Things. And perhaps also we may find <em>Reason</em> or <em>Intelligence</em> a proper Faculty to perceive and judge of it, without the Assistance of any adventitious Power; only let it be remembred, that it is not the <em>Beauty</em> or <em>Pleasure</em>, but only the <em>Rectitude</em> of moral Actions that we are enquiring after.

<strong>Our</strong> Author observes, as I before took notice, that <em>other Ways of speaking have been introduced</em>, which <em>seem to signify something different</em> from the two opposite Opinions before mentioned. And he concludes, that to render these intelligible, the <em>moral Sense</em> must be pre<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">pre- [supposed.] | supposed.</span></span>supposed. These <em>Ways of speaking</em>, as he calls them, are,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>That Morality of Actions consists in Conformity to Reason, and Deformity from it. That Virtue is acting according to the absolute Fitness of Things, or agreeably to the Natures and Relations of Things. That there are eternal and immutable Differences of Things, absolutely and antecedently; that there are also eternal and unalterable Relations in the Natures of the Things themselves; from which arise Agreements and Disagreements, Congruities and Incongruities, Fitness and Unfitness of the Application of Circumstances to the Qualifications of Persons</em>, &c. And here the Author refers us to that excellent, that inestimable Book, Dr. <em>S. Clarke<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Boyle<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Lectures</em>; from which, how it happened that a Person of his Discernment and Penetration rose dissatisfied, in relation to the Points before us, I am not able to imagine, unless I may have leave to attribute it to too close an Attachment to the celebrated Author of the <em>Characteristicks</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>To</strong> these Ways of speaking might be added some others; as, that <em>Virtue consists in the Conformity of our Wills to our Understandings</em>. That it is <em>a rational Endeavour of producing Happiness in capable Subjects</em>. But since both these and the former appear to me coincident, and to center in the same Idea, I shall not examine them severally, but content myself with laying down the Notion contained in them in the following <em>Definitions</em> and Explications. And <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">And [this] | this</span></span> this Method I therefore pitch upon, because our Author has complained of the Darkness or Ambiguity of several of the Terms. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
1. <strong>Virtue</strong>, <em>or moral Goodness, is the Conformity of our moral Actions to the Reasons of Things</em>. <strong>Vice</strong> <em>the contrary</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
2. <strong>Moral Actions</strong> <em>are such as are knowingly directed toward some Object intelligent or sensible</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I do not add their springing from free Choice; because without this they could not really be Actions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To treat or use an insensible Object conformably to Reason, or according to what it is, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it may be a <em>right</em> Action, yet is indifferent in respect of <em>Morality</em>; which only concerns our Behaviour to such Beings as are, at least, <em>sensible</em>. But as I exclude not here, Beings merely sensible, so neither do I exclude the Agent himself. To promote his own real Welfare, in subordination to that of the Publick, is in its Kind true Virtue.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
3. <em>The</em> <strong>Conformity</strong> <em>of such Actions to</em> <strong>Reason</strong>, <em>or the</em> <strong>Rectitude</strong> <em>of them, is their Agreeableness to the Nature and Circumstances of the Agents and the Objects</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;A <em>social</em> Action is then right, when it is suitable to the Nature and Relations of the Persons concerned. Thus a Person obliged acts <em>rightly</em> and <em>reasonably</em>, when his Actions are answerable to the Relation of Gratitude between him and his Benefactor.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Benefactor [4. <strong>Rela</strong>-] | 4. <strong>Relations</strong></span></span>
4. <strong>Relations</strong> <em>between Things or Persons, are their comparative States or Modes of Existence necessarily arising from their different Natures or Circumstances</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whether Relations be <em>Qualities inherent in external Natures</em>, or not; or however they may be defined, or conceived, they are certainly real, unalterable and eternal. That is, supposing those Natures always Continuing to be what they are, the Relations interceding between them are invariable. However, the Relations between Ideas are strictly necessary and unchangeable; the <em>Ideas</em> themselves being so in the divine Understanding.

5. <strong>Obligation</strong> may be considered as either <em>external or internal</em>. Of <em>external</em>, which arises from just Authority, I have no Occasion to speak&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<strong>Internal Obligation</strong> <em>is a State of the Mind into which it is brought by the Perception of a plain Reason for acting, or forbearing to act, arising from the Nature, Circumstances, or Relations of Persons or Things</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Internal Reasons of Things are the supreme<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Law, inducing the strongest Obligation, and affecting<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> all intelligent Beings. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we are certainly obliged to do whatever appears to be the Will of God, merely because it is his Will, and in consequence of that Right which <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">which [He] | He</span></span> He has to prescribe Laws to us; yet our Obligation to act conformably to Reason is even superior to this, because the Divine Will itself is certainly subject to the original Law or Rule of Action.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To suppose reasonable Beings unconcerned with the Reasons of Things, is to suppose them reasonable and unreasonable at the same time. The Reasons of Things are to Men, in respect of Practice, what Evidence is in Speculation. Assent in one Case, and Approbation in the other, are equally and irresistibly gained; only there is this Difference, that the Will has Power to rebel, and the Understanding has not. But whenever the Will does rebel, the immediate Consequence is an odious Perception of Wrong, and a Consciousness of Guilt, which may be looked upon as natural Sanctions of the Law of Nature.

6. <strong>Reason</strong>, or <em>Intelligence, is a Faculty enabling us to perceive, either immediately or mediately, the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas</em>, whether natural or moral.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;This last Cause, otherwise superfluous, is inserted upon our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Account; who seems to exclude <em>moral Ideas</em>, and to consider them as Objects of another Faculty. And indeed, if he had thought our Understandings capable of moral Perceptions, he would have had no Occasion for introducing his <em>moral Sense</em>, except in Relation to the &tau;&#8056;&nbsp;&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&#972;&nu;, concerning which I have already acknowledged myself undetermined. But it is visible, that he ascribes our Percep<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Percep- [tions] | tions</span></span>tions of the <em>Rectitude</em> of virtuous Actions to this <em>moral Sense</em>, or rather makes that Rectitude entirely consist in their Correspondence with it. Whereas if there be a real Rectitude in such Actions, I cannot doubt but our Understandings are capable of perceiving it. We have confessedly Ideas of Actions and Agents, and find a manifest Difference among them. We find likewise that some Actions are agreeable, others disagreeable, to the Nature and Circumstances of the Agent and the Object, and the Relations interceding between them. Thus, for Instance, we find an Agreement between the Gratitude of <em>A</em> and the Kindness of <em>B</em>; and a Disagreement between the Ingratitude of <em>C</em> and the Bounty of <em>D</em>. These Agreements and Disagreements are visible to every intelligent Observer, who attends to the several Ideas. The Question then is, Whether we perceive them by our <em>Understanding</em>, or by what our Author calls a <em>moral Sense?</em> And might it not as well be asked, How it is that we perceive the Agreement between the three Angles of a Triangle, and two Right ones? Will our Author say, that we perceive this by an<em> Intellectual Sense</em> superadded to our Understanding? I believe he will not. Why then does he ascribe the other Perceptions to a <em>moral</em> one? If<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> the Agreement or Disagreement of one Sort of Ideas be proper Ob<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ob- [jects] | jects</span></span>jects of our Understandings, why not those of another? Especially, since in many Cases, they are perceived with equal Clearness and Evidence. Let therefore our intelligent Faculty either be pronounced insufficient in both Cases, or in neither. Nay, since moral Perceptions are more useful and important than any other, there is peculiar Reason to conclude, that they belong to our supreme Faculty. It is not to be imagined, that the wise Author of Nature would frame our Minds in such a Manner, as to allot them only <em>Instincts</em> for the Purposes of Morality and Virtue, and at the same time grant them <em>Reason</em> and Intelligence for inferior Uses. This seems to me neither consistent with the Dignity of Virtue, nor the Supremacy of our rational Faculty.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
7. <strong>Truth</strong>, objectively considered, is either of <em>Words</em>, <em>Ideas</em>, or <em>Things</em>. By which last I mean external Natures. <strong>Verbal</strong> <em>Truth, or the Truth of Propositions, is their Conformity to one or both of the other two</em>. <strong>Ideal</strong> <em>Truth is the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas. Truth of</em> Things <em>is the relative Nature of Things themselves, or the Agreement or Disagreement of one Thing with another</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That <em>Ideas</em> correspond or differ, agree or disagree with each other, will readily be allowed, whether such Agreements or Disagreements be formed into Propositions or no. The Differences among them constitute various Relations, which are fixed and certain, independently of our Observation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In like manner <em>external</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>external</em> [<em>Natures,</em>] | <em>Natures,</em></span></span> <em>Natures</em>, in virtue of their essential or circumstantial Differences, abound in real Relations to one another, independently of Propositions, and in some sense, even of Ideas. The Things indeed themselves could never have existed without a Mind, and antecedent Ideas. But when they are once brought into Existence, and constituted in such or such a Manner, those Agreements or Disagreements, wherein Truth consists, flow necessarily from their respective Constitutions; and by Consequence, neither depend on the Perceptions of intelligent Beings, nor on the Will of the Creator himself. A cylindrical Body would be bigger than a conical one, of the same Base and Height, and spherical Particles fitter for Motion than angular, whether any Beings perceived it, or no.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;There are also the same real Agreements and Disagreements between Actions, Agents, and Objects, as any other Things. Some Actions are very different from and even contrary to others. There is likewise a wide Difference between the Nature of rational Creatures, and that of Brutes; and between the Nature of Brutes, and that of inanimate Things. They require therefore respectively a suitable Treatment. To treat <em>Men</em> in the same Way we treat <em>Brutes</em>, and to treat <em>Brutes</em> in the same Way we do <em>Stocks</em> and <em>Stones</em>, is manifestly as disagreeable and<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> dissonant to the Natures of Things, as it would be to attempt the forming of an Angle with two parallel Lines. I would not call such a <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">a [Conduct] | Conduct</span></span> Conduct <em>acting a</em> Lye, because that is confounding objective and subjective Truth, and introducing needless Perplexities. I would not call it a <em>Contradiction</em> to some true <em>Proposition</em>, because that neither comes up to the Case, nor is a Way of speaking strictly proper; but I would call it a <em>Counter-action to the Truth, or real Natures of Things</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;From hence it appears, how far, and with what Propriety a <em>morally good</em> Action may be said to be <em>conformable to Truth</em>, or to <em>consist in such a Conformity</em>. If by Truth be meant the <em>Truth of Things</em>, then I think it may properly be said, that the moral Goodness of an Action consists in a Conformity thereto. It may therefore be called either a <em>true</em> or a <em>right</em> Action; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> for Distinction sake, and the avoiding of Ambiguity and Confusion, I should constantly prefer the latter. However, since this <em>Truth of Things</em> is, in <em>Morals</em>, the Standard and Measure of <em>true Propositions</em>, which are no otherwise true, than as they agree with it; it is evidently more proper to represent moral Goodness as founded on the former, rather than the latter.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be asked, why it is not as proper to found it on <em>Ideal Truth</em>, as the <em>Truth of Things?</em> I answer, that in respect of divine Ideas it is the very same, all Things being created and framed according to those Models. But tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> external Natures are only <em>Copies</em> of the divine Ideas, yet in respect of ours, they are <em>Originals</em>, since our Ideas are all taken from them, as far as Morality is concerned. It is <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">is [true,] | true,</span></span> true, indeed, in <em>Mathematicks</em> our Ideas themselves are the Standards, Nature supplying no figures so exact as that Science requires: But in <em>Morals</em> our Ideas are only Representations of Natures and Relations actually existing. As far as our Ideas are conformable thereto, so far they are just; but we cannot in all Instances be absolutely secure that they are so. In some nicer Cases we may misapprehend the States and Circumstances of moral Agents, and the Relations between them. In Strictness therefore, the Foundations of Morality must be laid either in the Truth or Nature of Things themselves, or in the divine Ideas, which comes to the same Thing.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Nevertheless</strong>, in ordinary Cases, we may securely rely on our own Perceptions, the Objects of which, even in Morals, are often self-evident Truths, and almost always resolvable into such. The Reasons of Things, and the Relations between moral Agents, seldom fail of appearing to us in a clear Light; and that, as I before observed, without the Help of an additional Faculty. For the most part we perceive and understand what is <em>right</em> and what is <em>wrong</em> in Actions, as plainly and distinctly as we understand what is <em>true</em>, and, what is <em>false</em>; in <em>Propositions</em>; and both consist in the Relations discoverable between our Ideas; so that we have all the Grounds that can be, to conclude them equally Objects of <em>Intelligence</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To give Pain, without Cause, to a sensible Creature, is an Action, self-evidently <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">self-evidently [<em>wrong</em>,] | <em>wrong</em>,</span></span> <em>wrong</em>, as being directly repugnant to the Nature of the Object, and the Circumstances of the Agent: The Iniquity of it is as manifest to every Understanding, as the Difference between a Curve and a Straight-Line. We are certainly informed by our Senses, that <em>Pain</em> is a natural <em>Evil</em>; here is therefore a plain and perpetual Reason against the Infliction of it, when no stronger intervenes to make it requisite.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In like manner we certainly know that <em>Pleasure</em> is a natural <em>Good</em>; here is therefore a plain and perpetual Reason for the Production of it, whenever we have it in our Power, and are not hindered by a stronger.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Are then these Things, strictly speaking, <em>unintelligible?</em> Is it entirely owing to one Instinct, that we are guided by such Rules, and to another that we approve of them? Upon the whole, if we really have such a Faculty as Understanding, and its proper Object be Truth, we need not doubt but it is capable of discerning moral Rectitude, since this is entirely founded upon Truth, and ultimately consists in an Agreement with it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> it be objected to this Account of Virtue, that so small a Regard is had in it to <em>Affections</em> and <em>Temper</em>; my Answer is, that tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> I grant the Reality of such Affections, and the <em>Usefulness</em> of them, in respect of human Nature, yet I can by no means look upon them as <em>essential</em> to Virtue; nor can I think that any <em>Instinct</em> has a Place in its Constitution. To speak properly. Reason was not given us to regulate <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">regulate [natural] | natural</span></span> natural Affection, but natural Affection was given us to reinforce Reason, and make it more, prevalent. The inferior Principle must be intended as subservient to the superior, and not<em> vice versa</em>. Let Affection be allowed, if you will, antecedent in Order of Time; I neither know nor enquire how far in point of Use and Exercise it may get the start of Reason and Reflection: This will neither give it Pre-eminence, nor make it equal in Dignity; Sense and Memory are prior to the Use of Judgment, but still are inferior Principles.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;A benevolent Instinct is a very proper Introduction to Virtue; it may lead us, as it were, by the Hand, till we arrive at a Conduct truly virtuous, and that is founded on rational Principles; and even afterwards it may continue to quicken us in our Pursuits. But yet, as far as our Wills are determined, either by Instinct, or any thing else besides Reason, so far, I think, we can have no Pretension to Merit or Moral Goodness. However, as Instinct has a Tendency to moral Good, so it actually produces a great Share of natural Good. Doubtless, a great Proportion of the Benefits and good Offices that are done in the World, are to be ascribed to natural Affection, either wholly or chiefly. And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> this be no Proof of the Prevalence of true Virtue among Mankind, but rather an Argument of the contrary, yet most certainly it is a signal Instance, of the Wisdom and Goodness of the Creator, in providing such a wonderful Supply both for our <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">our [natural] | natural</span></span> natural Wants and our moral Defects.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But other and larger Concessions are to be made in behalf of <em>Affection</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> of a different Kind from that of <em>Instinct</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> seems to me an useful and material Distinction, to consider the <em>Affection of Benevolence</em>, either as <em>instinctive</em>, or as <em>rational</em>, as natural, or as acquired; acquired, I mean, by Reason, Reflection, and a consequent Practice. If we attend to the Reasons on which moral Goodness is founded, we discover its Rectitude and intrinsick Fitness. Why then may not this very Perception produce benevolent Affection, or a real Desire of Publick Good? and this Desire continue prompting Men to generous Pursuits, and be strengthened by suitable Practice? Is not such a <em>rational Benevolence</em> more agreeable to rational Natures, and more meritorious than a blind <em>Instinct</em> that we have in common with inferior Creatures, and which operates, as it were, mechanically, both on their Minds and ours? I have already granted; that we could not, without great Inconvenience, have wanted such an Impulse, and that great and good Effects are produced by it. I have also granted, that a natural Bias was proper to draw us into the right Path, and to prevent our being led astray, during the Infancy of our Reason; but still I must maintain, that this Impulse or Bias is not Virtue; nor can any thing be Virtue, but what consists in a rational Determination of the Mind. As our Fellow-Creatures are a proper Object of a <em>natural</em> Affection, so are they a proper Object of a <em>ra</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>ra</em>- [<em>tional</em>] | <em>tional</em> </span></span>tional one; and as that is good and useful, this is laudable and truly virtuous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It cannot, I think, be denied, but that <em>calm, universal Benevolence</em>, in Praise and Preference of which our Author often speaks, is more owing to Reason and Reflection than natural Instinct, where-ever it appears. And supposing us naturally void of publick Affection, I doubt not but Reason and Reflection would raise such a Benevolence as this, in considerate Minds.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only add, that tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> an <em>instinctive</em> and a <em>rational</em> Benevolence may make the same amiable Appearance in the Eyes of Men, who cannot indeed distinguish them in any Minds but their own; yet in the Sight of the Deity, I doubt not but the latter is much more acceptable and meritorious.

<strong>Again</strong>, if Virtue must be derived from some Affection, why not that Affection, of which Reason itself is the <em>Object</em>? And here again, I mean no <em>Instinctive Determination</em> of the Mind. As I spoke before of a <em>rational Benevolence</em>, of which Mankind is the Object; so here I speak of a <em>rational Love of Complacency</em>, the Object of which is Reason or moral Goodness itself. Whatever is good, absolutely good, will produce the Affection either of Complacency or<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Desire, in such Beings as are capable and willing to attend to its Excellence. Virtue<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> then, or moral Rectitude, being good <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">good [in] | in</span></span> in this Sense, will not fail to recommend itself to all, rational Minds that duly consider it. The <em>Congruity</em> between the <em>Object</em> and the <em>Faculty</em> is not arbitrary, as in other Cases, but necessary and unchangeable.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As to the <em>Beauty</em> of Virtue, that is a further Charm, as the <em>Pleasure</em> attending the Perception of it is an additional Recommendation. Whether these, especially the latter of them, belong not to some other Faculty than that of Intelligence, I leave to be enquired and determined by others: What I contend for at present, is, that without regarding, or thinking of the Pleasure it may yield, we esteem Virtue or moral Rectitude upon its own Account; that our <em>Affection</em> for it, is not an <em>instinctive</em> Determination, but raised and produced in the Mind by the intrinsick Worth and Goodness of the Object. Most other Objects are therefore good, because they are adapted to our Faculties, or our Faculties to them. But <em>Truth</em> and <em>Virtue</em> are good in themselves, and necessarily appear so to all Beings capable of perceiving them: Their Excellence is not borrowed or adventitious, but inherent and essential: They reflect not a foreign Light, but shine like the<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> Sun, with their own proper Rays and native Lustre.

<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Nature and Conduct of the Passions, p. 105.</span>
</aside>
<strong>Our</strong> Author, in his<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Nature and Conduct of the Passions</em>, makes mention of a <em>rational Desire</em>, and takes notice of <em>such Affections as seem to arise necessarily from a rational Appre</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"> <em>Appre</em>- [<em>hension</em>,] | <em>hension</em></span></span><em>hension of Good or Evil</em>. I cannot avoid thinking, that he would have done more Justice both to Virtue and Human Nature, if he had laid more Stress upon such Affections as these, and less upon Instincts. He grants,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> (speaking of Virtue) that <em>the lovely Form never fails to raise Desire, as soon as it appears</em>. But this Desire, according to his Notion, is only an <em>instinctive Affection</em>, suited and accommodated to its Object. And even this Object, <em>Virtue</em> itself, which he calls a <em>lovely Form</em>, appears, I think, in <em>his</em> Representation, far less lovely than it really is. For he has represented this <em>Loveliness</em>, not as absolute and necessarily inherent, but as factitious and communicated. According to him, suppose but the <em>moral Sense</em> inverted, and then <em>Vice</em>, as we now call it, becomes the <em>lovely Form</em>. But surely this is a Misrepresentation of Virtue, the Excellence of which is not precarious nor derived; but essential, absolute, and independant.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return; the <em>Rational Affections</em> beforementioned, springing from so noble a Principle, and operating jointly upon the Mind, along with natural Propensity, must needs constitute an excellent <em>Disposition</em>. The best and most desirable <em>Temper</em> in the World, must, I think, be that which consists in a <em>Rational universal Benevolence</em>, and an habitual <em>Complacency in Virtue</em>. Whether such Affections be considered as grafted upon natural Benevolence, or as distinct Principles co-operating with it; <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">it; [I ven-] | I venture</span></span> I venture to affirm, that the more any <em>Temper</em> is influenced by Reason and Reflexion, the better and nobler Effects it will produce, and render the Possessor more amiable and more deserving.

<strong>But</strong> the great Difficulty in our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Apprehension, is yet behind: He wants to be informed what are the Motives, Inducements, or <em>exciting Reasons</em> for the <em>Choice</em> of Virtue, and what the <em>justifying Reasons</em> of our <em>Approbation</em> of it. He seems to think these Questions are not to be answered upon the Scheme I am defending: Let us then try whether this Difficulty be not surmountable without the Help of those <em>Instincts</em> which he has introduced for that Purpose.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What is the <em>Reason exciting</em> a Man to the <em>Choice</em> of a virtuous Action? I answer, his very <em>Approbation</em> of it is itself a <em>sufficient Reason</em>, where-ever it is not over-ruled by another more powerful. What can be more just, what more natural, than <em>chusing</em> of a thing that we <em>approve</em>, and even chusing it for that very Reason?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But why then do we <em>approve?</em> or what <em>justifies</em> our <em>Approbation</em> of it? I answer in one Word, <em>Necessity</em>. The same Necessity which compels Men to <em>assent</em> to what is <em>true</em>, forces them to approve what is <em>right</em> and fit. And I cannot but wonder, that our Author should demand a Reason for the one more than for the other. In both Cases the Mind necessarily acquiesces, without regarding or considering the Effects or Tendencies of either.

<strong>If</strong> it be needful to enlarge upon this Matter, or take a further View of it, we need only call to mind what was before observed, <em>viz</em>. That Virtue being intrinsically worthy and excellent, fails not to produce a real <em>Affection</em> for itself, in all Minds that attentively consider it; it not only makes itself <em>approved</em>, but <em>admired</em>; not only <em>admired</em>, but <em>loved</em>, by those that contemplate it in a proper Manner: And the better any one is acquainted with it by Contemplation and Practice, the more amiable it becomes, and the higher his Affection rises. Is it then to be wondered, that rational Beings should <em>chuse</em> what they <em>love</em>, or, in other Words, embrace an <em>Object</em> of their <em>Affections?</em> Much less is it to be wondered in the present Case, where the peculiar Dignity and Excellence of the Object is confessed. Our Author grants, that<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>all Affections justify themselves:</em> What can this mean, but that they <em>justify</em> our <em>Approbation</em> and <em>Choice</em> of their respective Objects? If therefore it be true that we have, or may have, such an <em>Affection for Virtue</em>, or moral Goodness, as I have been speaking of, we shall need to seek no further, either for <em>Excitements to Election</em>, or Grounds of <em>Approbation</em>. Whether this <em>Affection</em> be looked upon as <em>natural</em> or <em>adventitious</em>, it will abundantly justify itself, and all the Regards that may be shewn for its Object.

<strong>But</strong> to return: Our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Question amounts plainly to this: What does a <em>reasonable</em> Creature propose in <em>acting reasonably?</em> Or what is it that induces his <em>Will</em> to take Counsel of his <em>Understanding?</em> As if this were not the very Essence of a rational Action! The Question therefore might as well have been put thus: What is it that induces a Man to be a rational Agent, when he has it in his Power to be otherwise? Besides, the <em>internal Reasons</em> which I am speaking of, there are indeed likewise <em>external Reasons</em>, if Considerations of Interest may properly be called so. Call them <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">them [what] | what</span></span> what we will, they must, and will be regarded by such Creatures as Men. But clamorous and importunate as they are, they leave us at liberty, in most Cases, to attend to those <em>internal Reasons</em> which I have been considering. The <em>still Voice</em> of Conscience may generally be heard amidst all the Bustle and Tumult of our Appetites and Passions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to come to the Point, if by the <em>End</em> which our Author enquires after, he means nothing but some Advantage or <em>natural Good</em>; my Answer is, that we may chuse reasonable or virtuous Actions, without Intention or View of any such <em>End</em>. But if I may be allowed to take the Word in another Signification, then I answer as follows.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The <em>End</em> of rational Actions and rational Agents, considered as such, is <em>Reason</em> or <em>moral Good</em>. As this is the proper <em>Object</em> of our <em>moral Capacity</em>, and the <em>Affection</em> corresponding thereto, it may properly be said to be our <em>End as moral Agents</em>. This Affection, like others, reaches out to its proper <em>Object</em>, and rests in the Possession of it, as its true <em>End</em>, whether it be, or be not connected with Happiness. The End of the Speculatist is <em>Truth</em>, whether it redound to his Advantage, or his Disadvantage. The End of the Moralist is <em>Rectitude</em>, whether it conduce to his Interest or no. Considered as<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Moral</em>, this is precisely the Mark that he aims at; his Judgment directing, and his Affection prompting to this <em>Object</em>, as in a peculiar Sense, self-worthy and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [self-] | self-eligible</span></span> self-eligible. In short, <em>moral Good</em> is an <em>End</em>, an <em>ultimate End</em> of one Kind, as <em>natural Good</em> is of another. And these Ends are so closely united and interwoven, that it is sometimes difficult to separate them even in our Conceptions. In the Pursuit of <em>Pleasure</em>, we have often the Consent and Concurrence of <em>Reason</em>; and when we pursue <em>Reason</em> or <em>Virtue</em>, <em>Pleasure</em> accompanies and follows. If we propose to make ourselves happy, we have Reason on our Side; and if we determine to act reasonably, Pleasure is the Consequence.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Nevertheless, they are in themselves, distinct Objects, and distinct Ends. However <em>Pleasure</em> may be the Consequence or Appendage of <em>Virtue</em>, yet, strictly speaking, it is not the <em>End</em> of a moral Agent, nor the <em>Object</em> of a moral Affection, but <em>Virtue</em> alone, antecedent to all Considerations, and abstracted from every natural Good. As Man is a <em>sensible</em> Creature, as well as <em>moral</em>, I deny not but certain Circumstances may be supposed, wherein, these <em>Ends</em> interfering, the <em>moral</em> Good would certainly be postponed to the <em>natural</em>, and the <em>external Reasons</em> unavoidably prevail over the <em>internal:</em> But such Cases can never come into Fact, and therefore need not be regarded. As God has framed our Natures in such a manner as makes it necessary for us to approve and pursue both these <em>Ends</em>, we may infallibly conclude, that he does not intend to suffer them finally to interfere.

<strong>If</strong> our Author denies that any Affection can have such an Object, or such an End, as is not <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">not [advan-] | advantageous</span></span> advantageous or <em>naturally good</em>, I must refer him to an Observation of his own. He himself produces<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> a remarkable Instance of an <em>Affection</em> continuing in pursuit of its <em>Object</em>, when known to be utterly useless and incapable of contributing, in any degree, to the Advantage of the Pursuer. The Object I speak of is <em>future Fame</em>, which he supposes would be desired even at the Point of Annihilation. Should he here be asked for an <em>exciting Reason</em>, he would answer, <em>Affection</em>; or for a <em>justifying Reason</em>, he would still answer, <em>Affection</em>; <em>all Affections justifying themselves</em>.

<strong>I</strong> would further observe, that <em>Virtue</em>, in this View, is no less <em>disinterested</em>, than in that of our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s. As he does not allow that the Pleasure which attends <em>benevolent Actions</em>, makes them interested, because the Agent is <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">is [not] | not</span></span> not excited or influenced by it; so neither can I allow that the <em>Love of Virtue</em> is interested, whatever Pleasure it may be attended with; forasmuch as Pleasure is no more the Motive or Excitement in this Case, than in the other.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Both <em>publick Affection</em>, and the <em>Love of Virtue</em>, gratify the Mind; but the Mind does not, or at least needs not, intend its own Gratification in either. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they be Affections of a different kind, yet they are, or may be, equally generous and disinterested. Whatever Pleasure Virtue may give in the Contemplation or Practice, that Pleasure is not the chief or primary Reason of our Approbation and Esteem. We approve and esteem it for its own intrinsick Worth, antecedently to every other Consideration.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only observe further, that as in Fact, we often pursue speculative Truths without so much as thinking of any Interest, and when we have found them, acquiesce in them: So<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> good Men often propose and undertake good Actions, without thinking of any Advantage or Pleasure at all. And when the Actions are social and directed to publick Interest, yet still the Love of Reason and moral Rectitude is often the leading Principle. The Agents are beneficent and kind, in obedience to the Dictates of <em>Reason</em>.

<strong>While</strong> we act up to the Character of rational Agents, we shall be sure to follow <em>Rea</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Rea</em>- [<em>son</em>,] | <em>son</em>,</span></span><em>son</em>, whether it call us out in quest of publick or private Good. <em>Reason</em> is the perpetual Arbitress of our several Claims and Pretensions, will inform us what we are to do for others, and what for ourselves; prevent the interfering of publick and private Interest, and adjust all imaginary Differences and Competitions between them. <em>Reason</em> may be considered as paramount and superior to every Interest, even that of the Publick, however it may decide in favour thereof. It would be improper and absurd to say, that we hearken to Reason for the sake of our Fellow-Creatures; but it is very just and proper to say that we oblige and serve our Fellow-Creatures, because Reason requires it. Reason both enjoins the Duty, and prescribes the Measures of it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> is manifest that Reason has placed every private Interest in Subordination to publick, and if Cases may be imagined, where this Order is inverted, it is certain that such Cases can never actually happen, and therefore it is needless to take Notice of them. Were the World without a <em>Governor</em>, or without a Governor of infinite Wisdom and Perfection, the Nature and Circumstances of Mankind would be a Scene of mere Disorder and Confusion. They would be frequently distracted between opposite and contradictory Obligations. Since we are <em>sensible</em> as well as <em>rational</em> Creatures, Reason alone can never be <em>self-sufficient</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it may be, and is <em>self-eligible</em>. Exclude the Belief of Providence and a future State, and in many Cases <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Cases [it] | it</span></span> it must be owned, Virtue would not be able to support itself. Adversity and great Misery would make Men deaf to the Dictates of their own Minds; would bring them down, as it were, from Reason to Sense; as the extreme Anguish and Torture of some Distempers have forced Men to quit their erect Posture, and crawl upon the Ground.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> this be a strong Argument for a future State, it is none against the Dignity of Virtue, or the Supremacy of a rational Principle. There can never be in Fact, a Necessity for opposing this, or departing from it; what ever there may be in Supposition or Speculation: However therefore Men may happen to counter-act their present Interest, it is unquestionably their Duty to follow where-ever Reason and Virtue lead them. He who formed them reasonable Creatures, and thereby unavoidably subjected them to the Dictates of Reason, will assuredly take Care that they be not finally Sufferers by their Adherence thereto. He will make abundant Compensation for every Loss, and every Disadvantage hereby occasioned. To imagine otherwise, is, in effect, to suppose Inconsistency and Contrariety in the very Frame of our Nature.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> know not whether I need to observe, that our Author ever seems to take it for granted there is no <em>absolute Good</em> but <em>natural Good</em>; and that <em>moral Good</em> is no otherwise such, than as it is subservient and conducive to <em>natural Good</em>. On the contrary, I affirm and main<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">main- [tain,] | tain,</span></span>tain, that tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> <em>moral Good</em> greatly promotes <em>natural Good</em>, it is moreover in itself an <em>absolute Good</em>. What Proof can we give of the absolute Goodness of Pleasure, but that we approve of it, upon its own Account, and pursue it for its own sake? The same Proof we have of the <em>absolute</em> Goodness of <em>Virtue</em>, which, considered by itself, and abstract from every other Thing, necessarily extorts our Approbation, and appears worthy of our Choice. Our approving and admiring it antecedently to those Satisfactions which flow from it, is an undeniable Proof of its absolute and inherent Worth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And as <em>Virtue</em> is absolute Good, as well as <em>Pleasure</em>, so that it is of a different and superior Kind, evidently appears from this single Consideration; that whereas <em>natural Objects</em> are only therefore good, because they gratify; <em>moral Objects</em> therefore gratify, because they are good. <em>Natural Good</em> is mere Gratification. In <em>moral Good</em> there is Gratification likewise, and that of the best and noblest Kind; but it is the Consequence of original and essential Goodness. The Correspondence or Congruity between natural Objects and their Faculties, is arbitrary and mutable; between moral Objects and their Faculties, necessary and immutable.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Of</strong> this Sentiment of our Author, which I last mentioned, the Opinion of the <em>Stoicks</em> seems to have been the Reverse. They had noble Ideas of Virtue, and clear Apprehensions of its Excellence, but unaccountably forgot, or overlooked the Constitution of Human Nature: <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Nature: [And] | And</span></span> And hence they fell into great Extravagance, and a kind of Enthusiasm. Wrapt up in Admiration of <em>moral Good</em>, they seemed not to acknowledge or regard any other. Had they considered that they were <em>sensible</em> Beings as well <em>as</em> moral, they could not easily have imagined that Virtue alone was <em>self-sufficient</em>. Their Scheme therefore must be unnatural and indefensible; I mean exclusively of a future State, the only Support of Virtue in Adversity and extreme Cases.

<strong>But</strong> to return; our Author lays it down, that <em>no</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Reason can excite to Action previously to some End</em>. To which I answer, that if <em>Reason</em> or <em>Virtue</em> were not itself an <em>End</em> to a Moral Agent, in the Manner explained above; it would still follow, that there might be a <em>Reason exciting to Action</em> without an <em>End</em>. Our <em>Approbation</em> of <em>Virtue</em>, and <em>Affection</em> for it, would certainly be <em>such a Reason</em>. That which is necessarily <em>approved</em> and <em>beloved</em> upon its own Account, <em>may</em> undoubtedly be chosen without any additional Motive. Though our Approbation of Virtue be necessary, yet that Necessity is only a Consequence of the intrinsic Goodness and Excellence of Virtue. Virtue is therefore worthy of that Approbation which it gains; and if worthy of our Approbation, why not of our Choice? Why should not that Worth which makes us necessarily approve of it in Speculation, recommend it to our Practice? Why should we not freely conform our <em>Actions</em> to our <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">our [<em>Judg-</em>] | <em>Judgments</em> </span></span> <em>Judgments?</em> If we plainly perceive that a Thing is <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em> to be done, and yet refuse to do it without further <em>Excitements</em>, do we not justly incur the double Imputation of Unreasonableness and Interestedness? If <em>external Reasons</em> be wanting, here is a strong <em>internal one:</em> a Compliance with which is, if I mistake not, the most perfect and most disinterested Virtue. I humbly presume the Goodness of the Deity himself proceeds from this Principle, and rests upon this Foundation. A perpetual Regard and Attachment to the <em>internal Reasons</em> of Things is the utmost Perfection of a moral Agent. Whether our Author will allow them to be an <em>End</em>, or <em>Excitements</em> without an End, must be left to his own Determination. But I think he must necessarily allow either the one or the other.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
He adds, that <em>no End can be proposed without some Instinct or Affection</em>. To which I answer, that it has been already acknowledged, that moral Agents have, and must have, an <em>Affection</em> for Virtue. But why must this <em>Affection</em> be an <em>Instinct</em>? Whatever Reasons there may be for an <em>instinctive Benevolence</em>, I can see none for an <em>instinctive Love of Virtue</em>. An Object that is and appears <em>Self-Good</em>, or intrinsically excellent, must necessarily produce <em>Esteem</em> and <em>Admiration</em> in all Minds capable of perceiving it. We find our Minds necessarily <em>determined</em> in favour of Virtue. But I presume such a <em>Determination</em> is not antecedent, but consequent to our Perceptions of this amiable Object. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Object. [Even] | Even</span></span> Even the <em>Desire of natural Good</em> seems to be in Reality no <em>Instinct</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> commonly called and reputed such. Our Affections indeed for particular Objects are manifestly <em>instinctive</em>, as it was requisite they should; but I see no need of supposing a <em>previous Determination</em> of the Mind, either to <em>natural</em> Good in general, or to <em>moral</em>. As soon as either comes to be perceived,, it necessarily determines the Mind towards itself. But this <em>Determination</em> being <em>consequent</em> to <em>Perception</em>, is, if I mistake not, improperly called <em>Instinct</em>. It is indeed <em>Affection</em>, but that Affection, I suppose, is <em>produced</em> in the Mind, not antecedently planted in it.

<strong>Our</strong> Author observes,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that if by <em>determining ourselves freely</em>, we mean, <em>acting, without any Motive or exciting Reason</em>, by <em>mere Election</em>; <em>such kind of Action</em> can never <em>gain</em> any one<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Approbation</em>. Now I readily grant there is <em>no Merit in acting without any Motive or Reason</em>. On the other hand, it may be affirmed that neither is there any <em>Merit in Actions</em> to which an Agent is driven by natural <em>Instinct</em>. The one of these is a worthless Use of Freedom, the other no Freedom at all. In the former Case the Man acts, but to no Purpose. In the latter he does not act, but is acted upon. Or, however, he is passive in proportion to the Influence and Operation of the Instinct. But <em>determining ourselves freely</em> to act and to do what appears conformable to <em>Reason</em>, is making the best use of both Faculties that we possibly can. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">can. [And] | And</span></span> And if there be no <em>Merit</em> in such a Conduct, we are capable of none. It is no Diminution of this Merit, that Virtue necessarily engages our Approbation, and attracts our Esteem. If all things were indifferent, and no <em>Reasons</em> appeared to incline our Wills one way more than another, we should have <em>Liberty</em> to no purpose. But surely there is a manifest and wide Difference between a <em>rational Determination</em>, and a <em>mere Impulse</em> of Nature. It is only <em>Reason</em>, or the Appearance of Reason, that can <em>justify</em> the <em>Choice</em> of a moral Agent; who is no further <em>Praise-worthy</em>, than as he acts in Conformity thereto. <em>Instinctive Goodness</em> is the <em>Creator</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Goodness, not the <em>Creature</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s; so far, I mean, as it proceeds from Instinct, and is owing thereto.

<strong>Let</strong> us suppose two Persons equally producing any given Quantity of Beneficence, or Moment of Good; the one merely from a sweet Disposition, and a high Degree of good Nature; the other from Reason, Reflection, and Resolution, without any such good natural Disposition, or in Opposition to a bad one; do I need to ask whether of these Characters is more meritorious and virtuous? The one steers his Course with the Advantage of a fair Wind, and a strong Tide; the other works his Way through a rough and stormy Sea, with great Care, Industry, and Application.

<strong>The</strong> one is, that <em>Virtue</em> may be taught, or promoted by Instruction; in Opposition to our Author, who<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> denies it: Agreeably enough, I confess, to his own Principles, which naturally lead him to such a Conclusion. For if Virtue consists in an Instinct and the Effects of that <em>Instinct</em>, it is evident that Instruction can avail little or nothing. But if, according to the foregoing Account, Virtue consist in the <em>Conformity</em> of Mens Actions to the <em>Reasons of Things</em>; the Advantage of moral Instruction must be very manifest.

And yet even in these Cases it may be very useful, as it is very practicable, to shew more particularly and distinctly, the Reasonableness, the Fitness, and the Excellence of a virtuous Practice; and the Unreasonableness and Unfitness, the Odiousness and Baseness, of a vicious Conduct. By these and other Topicks, properly insisted on, Men may acquire a Veneration for Virtue, and an Abhorrence of Vice, Good Dispositions may be raised or cherished in their Minds, and evil ones checked or rooted out.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And in respect of other Duties not self-evident, their Connection with such as are, may be discovered and laid open; or they may be unfolded and resolved into simple Truths, and self-evident Propositions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And as the Ignorant may thus learn what their several Duties are, so they may be induced and prevailed upon to comply with them, not only by external Motives, but by internal Reasons drawn from the Nature of Morality and Virtue. And surely it must turn to some Account, and tend to inspire Men with right Sentiments, and virtuous Purposes, to convince them how reasonable it is to do well, and how unreasonable to do ill. Such Instruction must be useful to the Ignorant, and may contribute to reclaim the Vicious. It doubtless tends to produce such an Effect. However, it must, I think, be allowed, that since Men are reasonable Creatures, and Virtue the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [most] | most</span></span> most reasonable thing in the World; there can be no Impossibility of reconciling, by Reason and Argument, the one to the other. Virtue therefore may be promoted by Instruction; or, in other Words, may be <em>properly taught</em>.

I cannot but observe, that<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>amiable Conceptions of our Fellow-creatures</em> are represented by our Author as necessary for the producing of Benevolence.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Moral Goodness</em> must be discovered in them, in order to <em>raise</em> our <em>Love</em>. But does he not confound the Affections of <em>Benevolence</em> and <em>Complacency?</em> Whether our <em>Fellow-creatures</em> be amiable or unamiable, deserving or undeserving, they are <em>sensible</em>, and, as such, Objects of our <em>Benevolence</em>. Their very <em>Sensibility</em> is their Title, which holds good where there is nothing else to be pleaded in their Behalf.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Here then is an Instance of the Benefit and Usefulness of Instruction. Men are too apt to imagine that the Worthless and the Wicked have no Claim to their Regard.

<strong>The</strong> other Consequence of the foregoing Account is, that there may be real Virtue in such Actions as respect the Agent himself, and are directed to his own Advantage. If Virtue consist in <em>acting conformably to Reason</em>, and if <em>Reason</em> not only allows, but requires the Agent (as it certainly does,)[ital] to regard his own Good, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Good, [in] | in</span></span> in Subordination to that of the Publick; it must needs follow, that such a Conduct is, or may be virtuous. On the contrary, our Author does not allow such Actions to be virtuous, any otherwise than as they conduce to publick Good, and are directed thereto. Thus<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Temperance</em>, for Instance, he grants to be laudable and virtuous under the foresaid Reference, but not otherwise. In no other Respect will he allow it to be <em>morally good</em>, however <em>naturally good</em>, <em>or advantageous to Health</em>.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> I presume there is other Merit besides this, in the Discharge of what we may call Self-duties. Were any Man supposed <em>alone</em>, without any <em>Fellow-creatures</em> in the Universe; would there be no Merit, no <em>moral Goodness</em>, in the highest Improvement of his Faculties, and the exactest Government of his Appetites and Inclinations? Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he conformed all his Actions to the Rules of right Reason; checking every Desire, and denying himself every Gratification inconsistent therewith; would there be nothing laudable, nothing meritorious in such a Conduct as this? On the contrary, would it not be very acceptable to the Deity, and procure the Man his Approbation and Favour? Why then, and upon what Account would it be thus acceptable? I suppose it will be answered, as the Man was hereby better fitted for the Discharge of those Duties which were owing to his Maker. But surely it must <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">must [be] | be</span></span> be granted, that his Maker would be incapable of receiving the least Benefit from such a Conduct. What Advantage therefore, or, <em>natural Good</em> the Man proposed, must terminate in himself, and be directed accordingly[.] But prior to this View must be supposed his Regard to <em>Moral Good</em>. Those Acts of Praises Adoration and Thanksgiving, which were offered by him to the Creator, must primarily and immediately flow from a Regard to <em>the intrinsick Reason and Rectitude</em> of the Thing; which is <em>Moral Good</em>; and secondarily (as Reason permits and prescribes) to his <em>own Advantage</em> or <em>Natural Good</em>; which indeed would be all the natural Good that he could have in view. Such an Homage, and such a Deference paid to that <em>sacred Law of eternal Truth and Rectitude</em>, which obliges even the Deity himself, and whose <em>Will</em> therefore it must be; is the truest Glory that can be given by a Creature to the Creator. It may be looked upon not only as a Submission to the <em>Divine Will</em>, but as a Conformity to the <em>Divine Understanding</em>; on the Agreement of which is founded that Goodness which is infinitely perfect.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return to the Supposition of the solitary Agent; if he only aimed at that <em>Self</em>-good to which <em>Reason</em> directed, and pursued it by the most reasonable and laudable Means; what could be wanting to denominate and constitute such a Behaviour truly virtuous? If neglecting the Care and Culture of his Mind, he gave himself up to sensual Pleasure, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [sub-] | subjected</span></span> subjected his Reason to his Appetites; as he must renounce all Pretension to Virtue, so he would grosly neglect his own Interest. But as he is supposed to take a quite contrary Method; he must either be reputed virtuous, or pronounced incapable of Virtue.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And as a due Performance of the Self-duties would be laudable and virtuous upon such a Supposition; so is it without the Supposition, though differently circumstanced. The Co-existence of innumerable <em>Fellow-creatures</em> makes room for Other Duties, and another kind of Virtue; but does not cancel the Obligation we are speaking of, nor extinguish the Merit and moral Rectitude of such Actions as respect ourselves.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>The</strong> primary Dictate of <em>Right Reason</em> is, that every moral Agent <em>intend the Good of the Whole</em>, or <em>aim at universal Good</em>. In this universal Good, the private Good of every Individual is included. From hence it follows, that if any Agent, in the View and Pursuit of common Good, could be supposed to exclude his own; such an Intention and such a Conduct would be less virtuous than if he had included it. It must therefore be granted, that for any Man to aim at his own Welfare, in Subordination to that of the Publick, is not only innocent, but morally good.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> such Self-views as these are perfectly <em>right</em> and <em>reasonable</em> in themselves; yet the Question is, how they are affected by the Circumstances of the Agent. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it be at least as reasonable to consult his own Good, as that of any other Individual; yet it must be allowed that a <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">a [good] | good</span></span> good Office done to another, appears generally more amiable, and even more virtuous, than, a like Kindness done to himself. How then comes it to pass, that <em>Social</em> and <em>Self-kindness</em> make such a different Appearance? Is there some peculiar Grace and Beauty superadded to our Perceptions of the former, by an <em>internal Sense</em> implanted in our Minds for that Purpose?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>However</strong> that be, the foresaid Difference is easily accounted for. Our <em>Self-affections</em> are so much stronger than <em>natural Benevolence</em>, and our private <em>Instincts</em> than <em>publick</em> ones; that the Regard shewn, and the Good done to ourselves appear in a great measure <em>necessary</em>. Considered in this Light, they must needs seem less amiable, and less meritorious than Actions done merely, or chiefly, <em>in Conformity to Reason</em>. What I observed before of <em>parental Kindness</em>, maybe here applied to <em>Self-love</em>; whether it be considered as an <em>Instinct</em>, or as a necessary Consequence of experienced Good. But though this Circumstance renders Self-kindness less amiable, and less meritorious; yet it does by no means set it upon a Level with Actions morally indifferent. And in some Cases it leaves room for a Conduct highly virtuous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However useful our <em>Instincts</em> may be, when under the Direction of Reason, as Nature designed; yet they are very insufficient Guides of themselves, for human Nature; and in many Cases would lead Men aside from their true Interest, instead of <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">of [bringing] | bringing</span></span> bringing them to it. Consider them as undirected by Reason, and we shall find that they prompt us to prefer a trivial Enjoyment that is present, to a very great one at a Distance. That they prompt us also to pursue sensual Gratifications to the Neglect of more refined Pleasures, and sublimer Enjoyments. These <em>Instincts</em> therefore, strong and powerful as they are, must be often restrained and resisted by the <em>Reason</em> of every Man who pretends to act either virtuously or wisely. In many Cases, instead of gratifying, he must oppose his keenest Appetites, and most urgent Inclinations, by a generous Self-denial. He must curb and keep in his eager Passions, lest instead of being subservient to a higher Principle, they run away with it. On these Accounts there is abundant room for the Exercise of <em>Self-virtue</em>, notwithstanding the Strength and Prevalence of <em>Self-love</em>. Accordingly we find that such a Conduct appears not only <em>reasonable</em> and <em>right</em> but <em>beautiful</em> and <em>lovely</em>; and that it is beheld by others with Pleasure, as well as Approbation, To see a Man engaged in a resolute Struggle with a froward Disposition; to see, him resisting a clamorous Appetite, or subduing a head-strong Passion; cannot but be agreeable to intelligent Spectators, whether they regard his Actions in relation to Society or no. And indeed were the Agent <em>alone</em> in, the<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> World, according to the foregoing Supposition, such a Conduct would still be amiable, still meritorious. Thus, I think, it <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">it [plainly] | plainly</span></span> plainly appears, that aiming at private Welfare is not inconsistent with real Virtue; but when rightly circumstantiated, productive of it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only add, that the greatest <em>Self-good</em> which a Man can possibly propose, is the <em>perpetual Enjoyment of Virtue</em>. Such an Aim will be allowed to be virtuous, as the Good aimed at is necessarily connected with publick Interest, or the Good of the Whole. And yet it is manifest in this Case, that private Advantage is a real Part of the Object desired. Nevertheless this is so far from lessening the Goodness of the Pursuit, that it increases it, as I before observed. To be influenced in our Conduct by the Prospect of such a <em>Reward</em>, can be no Diminution of our present Virtue; but is, on the contrary, an Addition to it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Upon</strong> the whole, our End and our Business, as Men and <em>Moral Agents</em>, is to pursue <em>Virtue</em>, leaving the Consequence to our Maker; who, as he has made us capable of <em>Truth</em>, <em>Virtue</em>, and <em>Happiness</em>, will undoubtedly take care to make them finally compatible and co-incident. So great is, or will be, the Harmony among them, that they may rather be looked upon as one and the same End, than as distinct and several.

<span class="pagno"></span>I Have carefully considered the Remarks which you did me the Honour to write on my little Book; and without much Prefacing, shall endeavour to give as clear and distinct an Answer as I can, to the several Arguments and Objections therein contained. I desire I may be excused if I sometimes transgress in point of Brevity. Where-ever I meet with an Opportunity of illustrating and enforcing the Proofs made use of in my former Papers, I shall take the Liberty of enlarging a little with that View, that I may answer, as far as I am able, both Intentions at the same time. As I think it the fairest way, so I presume it will be most agreeable to the Reader, to set down at length every Article of your Observations, and to subjoin my Answers as I go along. But before I begin, I judge it incumbent on me to inform the Reader, that these your Remarks were drawn up with a private Design, and without any Thought, at that time, of having them made publick.

<strong>Article</strong> I. You define <em>Reason</em> to be <em>a Faculty enabling us to perceive, either immediately, or mediately, the Agreement, or Disagreement of Ideas, whether Natural or Moral</em>. This Agreement, or Disagreement, you do not suppose to be any Likeness or Unlikeness in the Ideas, but only such a Conformity as makes them concur towards the forming of some Proposition or Conclusion. Thus by the Agreement of the Ideas of the Numbers 2, 3, with that of 5, it follows that 2 and 3 are equal to 5; not for any Likeness, or Resemblance that there may be in those Ideas, but that in the Essence of those Ideas that Truth is necessarily included. I have no Objection to the Definition, taken in this Sense.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Answer.</strong> By that <em>Agreement of Ideas</em> which I make to be the Object of <em>Reason</em> or <em>Intelligence</em>, I do not mean any particular Agreement, but any, or every kind of Agreement that we are capable of discovering in our Ideas. As Ideas themselves are of various Kinds, so the Relations interceding be<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">be- [tween] | tween</span></span>tween them are conformably different. <em>The Agreement of Arithmetical Ideas</em> is, I suppose, either that of <em>Equality</em>, or that of <em>Proportion</em>; and their Disagreement either that of Inequality, or Disproportion. Between the Numbers 2, 3, and that of 5, the Relation or Agreement is that of <em>Equality</em>. Between the Numbers 1 and 4, and 4 and 16, the Relation or Agreement is that of <em>Proportion</em>. And such Relations necessarily and eternally belong to such Ideas, whether any Propositions or Conclusions be formed about them or not. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered article">
<strong>Art</strong>. II. But then it must be observed, that the Agreement which we find between Gratitude and Bounty, and the Disagreement of Ingratitude with Kindness received, are Expressions, which, if used with any Truth, must be taken in a quite different Meaning from that wherein they are to be understood in the Definition above.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. Since <em>Moral Ideas</em> are very different from all others, especially <em>Arithmetical</em> ones, no Wonder if they exhibit different <em>Relations</em>. Between the Ideas of <em>Bounty</em> and <em>Gratitude</em> there is a manifest Congruity, which is commonly called <em>Moral Fitness</em>. Whatever Terms or <em>Expressions</em> may be used about them, the Ideas themselves correspond, and, as it were, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">were, [tally] | tally</span></span> tally to each other with great Exactness. No Disposition of Mind can possibly be thought of so suitable to the Case and Circumstance of a Person obliged, as that of Gratitude, or any Actions so just and proper, and fit, as those which flow from thence. The Ideas of <em>Bounty</em> and <em>Gratitude</em> are so closely connected; and the Agreement between them is so visible and clear, that no Man can overlook it, or be insensible of it. The most ignorant understand it, as the most vicious are forced to acknowledge it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What is it then that knits these Ideas together, and establishes the Conformity between them? Is the Agreement arbitrary, or dependent on the Will of any Agent? No, not even the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s. It springs from the same <em>Necessity of Nature</em> that makes the Three Angles of a Triangle equal to two Right ones; or that fixes a certain Proportion between a Cone, and a Cylinder of the same Base and Height. Can then such an <em>Equality</em> or <em>Proportion</em> be ascribed to those Moral Ideas, as belongs to these Mathematical ones? Those Terms are used and applied to both Kinds, but not precisely in the same Sense. They belong originally to Ideas of Quantity; and when they are used to denote <em>Moral Fitness</em>, their Signification is somewhat figurative. But concerning the Meaning, or Propriety of Terms, I have no Dispute at present. However the Agreement between Moral Ideas may be denominated or distinguished, what I contend for is, that the Ideas them<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">them- [selves] | selves</span></span>selves invariably bear such Relations to each other; which are no less certain, and often times more immediately evident than the Equality or Proportion between the forementioned Angles and Figures. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered article">
<strong>Art</strong>. III. The Ideas of Bounty and Gratitude are, if you please, Moral Ideas; but no Moral Proposition can rightly be deduced from them: Or however, no such Proposition as includes any sort of Obligation. From the mere Idea of Gratitude, it will no more follow that Men ought to be grateful, than from the Idea of Ingratitude, that they ought to be ungrateful, if we suppose no Sentiment. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. If <em>Moral Ideas</em> had no <em>Relations</em> belonging to them, or if these Relations were imperceptible to Human Understandings; then it might justly be said, that our <em>Moral Ideas</em> yielded us no <em>Proportions</em>. But since some of these Ideas agree, and others differ, as much at least as any other Ideas; and since these Agreements and Differences are commonly very evident to all who will attend, it follows, that Moral Ideas must needs be equally fruitful of Propositions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Idea <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Idea [of] | of</span></span> of Gratitude cannot properly be said to infer any Obligation. But when a Man compares the Idea of Gratitude with that of a Benefaction received, and examines the Relation between them, he cannot avoid inferring, or concluding that he ought to be grateful. This will be farther considered under the three following Articles. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered article">
<strong>Art</strong>. IV. If we had otherwise no Idea of Obligation, the Ideas of Gratitude, Ingratitude, and Bounty, could never so much as afford us a general Idea of Obligation it self; or inform us what is meant by that Term; much less could we be able to deduce the particular Obligation to Gratitude from these Ideas. 
</div>

<strong>Ans</strong>. If receiving of Benefits be a <em>good Reason</em>, as it certainly is, why the Receiver should be <em>grateful</em>, then it <em>obliges</em> him so to be. I observed in my former<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Papers, that the Perception of such a Reason perpetually binds all Rational Agents, and is indeed the first and highest of all Moral Obligations. The Dictates and Directions of Right Reason are the very Rule which the Deity Himself inviolably observes, and which therefore must <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">must [needs] | needs</span></span> needs affect all intelligent Creatures.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Ideas of <em>Benefits</em> and <em>Obligations</em> are so closely connected, that to <em>do a Man a Kindness</em>, and to <em>oblige him</em>, are used promiscuously, as Expressions of the same Signification.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Every Man who receives a Benefit, receives along with it a Reason for Gratitude: And that Reason he must perceive, if he be not quite thoughtless. What <em>Instinct</em> prompts him to, his <em>Understanding</em> will immediately second and confirm. His Reason will readily suggest to him what Behaviour is due to his Benefactor, and inform him that no Actions but <em>grateful</em> ones, can be in any degree <em>suitable</em> or <em>fit</em>. To be <em>injuriously</em>, or even <em>indifferently</em> affected towards him, will appear as absurd, as incongruous, as Contrary to the Nature of Things, as it would be for a Husbandman, after a full Crop, to cover his Ground with Flints instead of Manure. No Affections, no Actions, and by Consequence, no Ideas, can possibly be more unsuitable, or mismatched, than Kindness and Ingratitude.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Moral Actions, like other Things, agree or disagree, essentially and unalterably. Hence flow those Relations and Reasons whereon Morality is founded, and which derive Obligations upon all Agents Capable of perceiving them. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered article">
<strong>Art</strong>. V. If you will affirm, that by comparing these Ideas in your Mind, you can perceive any such Moral Pro<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Pro- [position] | position</span></span>position necessarily included, <em>viz</em>. that a Man ought to be grateful; I ask, Whether you see that necessary Consequence immediately upon comparing these Ideas, or mediately by the Help of some intermediate Reasoning or Proof? If you see such a Connection immediately, or, as it were, intuitively, I wonder every body else cannot see it. If you have any intermediate Reasonings or Proofs, pray let us have them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. That a Man ought to be grateful to his Benefactors, may be looked upon as equivalent to a self-evident Proposition. If it need any Proofs, they are so obvious and clear, that the Mind perceives them in an Instant, and immediately allows the Truth of the Proposition. Between <em>Bounty</em> and <em>Gratitude</em> there is a plain Congruity of <em>Moral Fitness</em>; and between <em>Bounty</em> and <em>Ingratitude</em> a plain Incongruity, or <em>Unfitness</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Therefore Gratitude is <em>reasonable</em>, and Ingratitude <em>unreasonable</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Therefore the one ought to be <em>observed</em>, and the other <em>detested</em>. As these Conclusions appear to me incontestable, so I presume the Principle from whence they flow is strictly self-evident. Ingratitude is not only shocking to Natural Affection, but necessa<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">necessa- [rily] | rily</span></span>rily appears to the Understanding irregular, disproportioned, monstrous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But if this Principle, and the Connection of those Conclusions with it, be so plain and evident, how happens it that they are ever called in question? I answer, That Mens Understandings, like their Eyes, may possibly be sometimes dazled with too much Light. Doubts and Scruples have been raised, one time or other, concerning the plainest and most evident Truths in the World, even by Philosophers and Men of Letters. But as to the Points before us, I may appeal to the general Judgment of Mankind.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let any illiterate Man be asked these plain Questions: Is not Ingratitude to a Benefactor very unfitting?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Is it not therefore very unreasonable?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Ought it not therefore to be abhorred and avoided by every body? To each of these Questions, he will, I doubt not, without any Hesitation answer in the Affirmative. Should he be further asked, Whether he really <em>understood</em> these Truths? he would not only make the same Answer, but be surprised at the Question.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered article">
<strong>Art</strong>. VI. I know not well what you mean by this Expression, <em>viz</em>. <em>That our Understandings are capable of Moral Perceptions</em>. I believe every body agrees that in some Sense they are; that <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">that [is,] | is,</span></span> is, that the Mind is capable of receiving or forming Moral Ideas: But it will not follow from hence, that Obligation is deducible merely from our Moral Ideas, without supposing any Sentiment.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. In saying that <em>our Understandings are capable of Moral Perceptions</em>, I mean, that they are not only capable of forming Ideas of <em>Agents</em> and <em>Actions</em>, but of perceiving likewise the Relations of Agreement and Disagreement between them. From these Relations, <em>Obligation</em> is plainly deducible in the Manner beforementioned. But I shall here lay it down more particularly.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I have already observed, that between such and such <em>Agents</em>, <em>Actions</em>, and <em>Objects</em>, naturally and necessarily intercede certain <em>Relations</em> of <em>Agreement</em> or <em>Disagreement</em>, <em>Fitness</em> or <em>Unfitness</em>: Conformably whereto, the same Relations are observable between their respective <em>Ideas</em>; which, when just, always correspond to <em>Things</em> themselves. For the Reality of these Relations, every Man must be referred to his own Perceptions, since they admit of no other Proof! Such <em>Fitnesses</em> or <em>Unfitnesses</em> are as manifest to our Understandings, as it is visible to our Eyes that <em>Blue</em> is not <em>Green</em>, or <em>Scarlet</em>, <em>Yellow</em>; or to our Imaginations, that a <em>Triangle</em> is not a <em>Circle</em>, or a <em>Cone</em>, a <em>Cube</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered"> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Cube</em>. [<strong>The</strong>] | <strong>The</strong></span></span> The next Point to be considered, is, whether Actions thus <em>fit</em>, be not therefore <em>reasonable</em>, and Actions unfit, therefore unreasonable. If this <em>Moral Fitness</em> of certain Actions be not a Reason for the doing of them, I see not how any Thing can be a Reason for any Thing. <em>Moral Fitness</em> is Conformity to Order and Truth; and if our Reason did not approve of this, we should have Cause to conclude it an irregular, disorderly Faculty. But it is certain that our Reason does approve of it, and that necessarily. The intrinsick Goodness of such Actions is an irresistible Recommendation to our Minds and Judgments, and by Consequence, is a perpetual Reason for the Concurrence of our Wills. Those Actions therefore which our Reason approves as self-worthy, and which are chosen and done with that View, and upon that Account, must not only be <em>reasonable</em>, in the strictest Sense of the Word, but in the highest Degree that our Actions are capable of. However, we must either allow those Actions to be <em>reasonable</em>, for the doing of which a good Reason may be given, and which our Faculty of Reason approves of; or it will follow, that none of our Actions are or can be reasonable.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
What remains, is to deduce from hence the <em>Obligation</em> that we are now enquiring after. How does it appear that we <em>ought</em> to do what is <em>reasonable?</em> As Moral Agents, we are either obliged to this, or nothing. But what is it we mean by <em>Obligation?</em> Certainly <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Certainly [not] | not</span></span> not <em>Compulsion</em>. Since <em>Obligation</em> supposes <em>Liberty</em>, it must be something consistent with Liberty. It supposes likewise some <em>Perception</em> in the Mind, since no Agent can be obliged to or by any thing while he is ignorant of it. What is it then, which as soon as perceived, produces that State of Mind which we call <em>Obligation?</em> It must be some <em>Motive</em>, some <em>Inducement</em>, some <em>Reason</em>, that is fit to influence and incline the Will, and prevail with it to chuse and act accordingly.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Is not then <em>Interest</em> or <em>Pleasure</em> such an Inducement? It is in respect of <em>sensible Agents</em>, considered as such. And thus it is that Men, as <em>sensible Agents</em>, are <em>obliged</em> to pursue <em>Pleasure</em> or <em>Natural Good</em>; which as soon as they have experienced, they naturally and necessarily approve: But considered as <em>Moral Agents</em>, they have no Concern with <em>Natural Good</em>. I took notice in my former Papers, that <em>Moral Good</em> is the only Object of <em>Moral Affection</em>, and the only Aim or End of <em>Moral Agents</em>, who are influenced and attracted by it, as <em>sensible Agents</em> are by <em>Natural Good</em>. As the latter therefore are <em>obliged</em> to pursue their End, which I call <em>Interest</em> or <em>Pleasure</em>; so the former are <em>obliged</em> to pursue theirs, which is <em>Moral Rectitude</em>, <em>Reason</em>, or <em>Virtue</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I intend not by this to set Natural and Moral Obligations on a Level, but to shew the Nature and Grounds of Obligation in general. In what Respects they differ, and how far the one are superior <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">superior [to] | to</span></span> to the other, are Points not to be now discussed without too long a Digression.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I proceed therefore to observe, That the Obligation which arises from <em>Authority</em>, may be looked upon as compounded of the other two. <em>Laws</em> affect us in one Capacity, and <em>Sanctions</em> in another. As <em>sensible Agents</em> we are obliged to aim at Rewards, and avoid Punishments: As <em>Moral Agents</em>, we may be doubly obliged. It is morally fit and just to pay Obedience to a rightful Legislator, in all Cases not over-ruled by some higher Authority; and if, moreover, his Laws be in themselves <em>morally good</em>, our Obligations rise in Proportion.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
It appears, I think, from what has been said, that <em>Moral Obligations</em> are strictly connected with <em>Moral Fitness</em>, and the <em>Reasons</em> of Things. To resolve all Obligations into <em>Interest</em>, or <em>natural Good</em>, seems to me confounding <em>Morality</em> with <em>Sensibility</em>. It is in effect to say that <em>Virtue</em> is not <em>good in itself</em>, nor any otherwise good, than as it <em>does us good</em>.

[sic] And indeed whatever appears worthy of <em>Approbation</em> and <em>Esteem</em>, as Virtue does in the highest degree, must needs appear worthy of <em>Choice:</em> And what appears worthy of Choice, <em>ought</em> to be chosen; or in other Words, Men are <em>obliged</em> to chuse it. In short, whatever Agent <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Agent [is] | is</span></span> is said to be under an <em>Obligation</em> to the Performance of any Action, the true Meaning of such an Expression, as it appears to me, is, that he perceives some <em>good Reason</em>, either <em>internal</em> or <em>external</em>, Moral or Natural, for the Performance of it. What falls short of this, can be no Obligation; and what goes beyond it, must be Coaction.

I might proceed to shew by various Considerations, that <em>Reason</em> is and must needs be, the first and most essential <em>Law</em> of our Nature; that Homage and Obedience are indispensibly due to it, on account of its absolute Worth, and uncreated Excellence; that it presents it self to our Minds not only as a <em>Law</em>, but as a kind of <em>Legislator</em>, rewarding our good Actions with pleasing Reflections, and punishing our bad ones with painful After-Thoughts, and the Stings of Remorse. I might further observe, that the Breach of any Moral Obligation is not only recollected with Regret, but disturbs and embitters our natural Enjoyments; Whereas the Remembrance of rejected Pleasure is seldom disquieting, and sometimes highly satisfactory. But as these Topicks would carry me too far out of my way, so the insisting on them might be looked upon not as <em>answering</em>, but <em>preaching</em>.

VIII. <em>To give Pain</em>, you say, <em>without Cause, to a Sensible Creature, is an Action self-evidently wrong, as being directly repugnant to the Nature of the Object, and the Circumstances of the Agent</em>. If you allow the Agent to have an internal Sentiment disposing him to the Good of Sensible Creatures, giving Pain will certainly be repugnant to the Circumstances of the Agent: But allowing no such Sentiment, however Pain may be repugnant to the Nature of the Object, I do not think it appears self-evidently, or by any Deduction in the World, that such an Action is wrong. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. I allow the Agent to have <em>Natural Affection</em>, or a Principle of Humanity; which I presume is what is here meant by an <em>internal Sentiment</em>. But I laid no Stress upon it, nor had any Regard to it in that Affection. By the <em>Circumstances of the Agent</em>, I meant only his being a Rational, or Moral Agent, and his having no Cause or Reason to give Pain. For such an Agent <em>to give Pain to a sensible Creature</em>, must be <em>wrong</em>, if it be <em>morally unfit</em>. And that it is morally unfit, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">unfit, [seems] | seems</span></span> seems to me as plain and evident as any Proposition can be. It is as contrary to <em>Nature</em>, and to the <em>Truth of Things</em>, as to give a thirsty Man <em>Poison</em> instead of <em>Drink</em>. It is contrary to the Nature of the <em>Object</em>, because he naturally desires Indolence and Pleasure, and shuns Pain. It is contrary to the Nature and Circumstances of the <em>Agent</em>, because he being Rational, must act unnaturally whenever he acts unreasonably. And he must act unreasonably, when he acts both without and contrary to Reason. Now he is supposed to have no Reason for giving Pain, and yet must see a good Reason for not giving it. For where there is no Reason for Pain, there is always a good Reason against it, arising from the Nature of the Thing it self. If it be repugnant to the Nature of a Rational Agent to act without Reason, as it certainly is, how much more repugnant must it be to counteract it, and produce an effect so much worse than nothing?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Supposing then the Agent to know what <em>Pain</em> is, and likewise that the Object is a <em>sensible</em> Creature, and himself a <em>Rational</em> one; he must needs perceive an immediate and glaring Disagreement between such an <em>Action</em> coming from him, and such an <em>Object</em>. If this Proposition be not strictly self-evident, yet it is easily resolved into such as are so; nothing being capable of a plainer or more familiar Demonstration. Whatever is contrary to the Nature or Truth of Things, is <em>wrong</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Such an Action is <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">is [contrary,] | contrary,</span></span> contrary, &c.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The latter of these Propositions has been just now proved. The former is strictly self-evident. Whoever allows all <em>Contradictions</em> to Truth to be <em>false</em>, must allow all <em>Counteractions</em> to Truth to be <em>wrong</em>. These two Propositions being exactly parallel, must either be both self-evident, or neither.

<strong>Ans</strong>. Those Actions must be <em>wrong</em>, which are Deviations from <em>Order</em> and <em>Truth</em>. To give Pain without Cause to an innocent Person, is an Action highly <em>irregular</em> and <em>disorderly</em>, because there is a visible and odious Disagreement between <em>Action</em>, <em>Agent</em>, and <em>Object</em>. And upon the same Account it is counteracting the <em>Truth</em> of Things. To give causeless Pain to an innocent Person, is to treat him, I will not say as a Malefactor, but as something worse. In respect of a <em>Malefactor</em>, there is <em>a Cause</em>, <em>a Reason</em>, for the Infliction of Pain. But in the Case before us, there is neither that Reason; nor, by the Supposition, any other. It is therefore acting, as the Agent would and ought to act, supposing <em>In</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>In</em>- [<em>nocence</em>,] | <em>nocence</em></span></span><em>nocence</em> deserved to be <em>punished</em>, and that he had a Right to punish it. Is not this then a notorious Misapplication of Pain? Is not the Action visibly absurd and inconsistent?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever <em>End</em> an Agent may propose to himself, if he act contrary to all Rnles, [sic] such an Action must be<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>wrong</em>. But in such Actions as that I am considering, the very <em>End</em> it self must be <em>wrong</em>. The gratifying of a cruel Disposition is an immoral View, a criminal Design. Not to mention the Unreasonableness of it, it implies greater Corruption of Heart, and Pravity of Affection, than any Man can arrive at without his own very great Fault: Even <em>natural Instinct</em> must have been violated, as well as <em>Reason</em> and <em>Truth</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It does not follow that an Action is <em>morally wrong</em>, because it is occasioned by <em>some Error in the Mind</em>. Suppose for Instance, that Alms or Bounties are misapplied through Misinformation, or Mistake, the Actions notwithstanding may be morally Good. In this Case the Goodness of them is founded on the Agreement between the <em>Agent</em>, and the <em>supposed Objects</em>. Where <em>real Rectitude</em> is not to be had, <em>Ideal</em> takes place, and becomes the sole Rule. According to the old Distinction, such Actions may be <em>materially wrong</em>, but they are <em>formally</em> right; since the Agent is supposed to act to the best of his Knowledge.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. If by <em>End</em> he meant <em>Aim</em>, <em>View</em>, <em>Reason</em>, or <em>Design</em>, the Proposition is undeniable. But if by End be meant only some <em>natural Good</em>, I can by no means agree to it. Considered as a <em>sensible</em> Agent, Man is obliged to make the <em>Utile</em> or the <em>Jucundum</em> his End; considered as a <em>Moral</em> Agent, the <em>Honestum</em>. But what is to be got by aiming at such an End as this? As Matters are wisely and graciously ordered, almost every thing is to be got by it. But supposing it otherwise; as we are <em>Rational</em> Beings, we must necessarily approve of <em>Reason</em> and <em>Virtue</em>: And if we reject what we approve, we are self-condemned. Though Virtue offered us no Reward, we ought to adhere to it, because it is <em>self-amiable</em>, and <em>self-good</em>. The greatest, the best, and most perfect Agent in the Universe perpetually acts with this View; though he neither does, nor possibly can reap any Advantage from it. He constantly acts thus, because it is <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em> so to do. Before any Creatures existed, or the Foundations of the World were laid; He saw, approved, and admired this essential Good, this necessary Excellence.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If <em>Reason</em> be the proper Guide and Law of our Nature, it can <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">can [never] | never</span></span> never be wrong to follow it, but it must always be wrong to forsake it. To reject as <em>worthless</em>, what our Judgments pronounce to be most <em>worthy</em>, is an unnatural Absurdity, and a practical Contradiction.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Since Men are <em>sensible</em> Creatures as well as <em>rational</em>, Reason allows them to aim at <em>Natural Good</em>, as well as <em>Moral</em>. Accordingly, the all-wise Creator has, in a great Measure, linked these Ends together, and made them inseparable: that accidental Opposition which we sometimes find between them in this Life, being, comparatively, inconsiderable. But let us suppose <em>Virtue</em> and <em>Interest</em> neither in Conjunction nor Opposition; or let us suppose a Man in Possession of all his Desires. Would it, upon this Supposition, be <em>wrong</em> and <em>foolish</em> in him, to perform several Actions, merely because he saw them to be just, fit, reasonable, virtuous? If it would, the Consequence must be, that the same Action may be <em>right</em> and <em>wrong</em>, reasonable and unreasonable at the same Time. I mean, not in different Respects, but upon the whole, which is a manifest Contradiction.

To give a Reason why any <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">any [Object] | Object</span></span> Object ought to be pursued as an End, is to shew that Object is not really an End, but Only the Means leading to it. Nature alone can recommend to us the Ends of our Pursuit; Reason can only discover the most probable Means of obtaining them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. <em>Reason</em> is not only our <em>Rule</em>, considered as <em>Moral Agents</em>, but it is likewise our <em>End</em>. It informs us that we ought to regard it as such, and to <em>follow it for its own sake</em>. It is <em>absolue [sic] Good</em>, and in the strictest Sense <em>self-eligible</em>. It does indeed direct us in the Pursuit of <em>natural Good</em>. But is this all that can be said for it? If it be, then Virtue can only be looked upon as ministerial to Profit and Pleasure. I think it appears from what I have observed, both in these and my former Papers, that this is far from being the Case. At the same Time that the <em>Sun</em> gives Light for the meanest Occasions, and lowest Purposes of Life; it illuminates the whole System, and appears it self the noblest Object in it. Thus it is with <em>Right Reason</em>, or Moral Good. It shews indeed how to proceed in our inferior Pursuits, and gives Weight to our least Actions; but at the same time it raises our Minds to higher Contemplations, and presents itself to our View, as <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">as [an] | an</span></span> an Object of supreme Worth, and unrivalled Perfection.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
So great and splendid did this Good appear to some of the ancient Philosophers, that it dazzled their Eyes, and overpowered their Senses. All inferior Objects vanished before it, and they could find no Good in any Thing else. But as it is not true, that Virtue is the only Good; so much less is it true, that there is no intrinsick Goodness in it; or that it is not worthy to be pursued <em>for its own sake.</em>

<div class="indented numbered">

<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> In the former Part, (<em>Page</em> 90.) Pleasure was called <em>absolute Good</em>, but perhaps unadvisedly; or however, less properly.</span>
</aside>
It is upon his own Account, and <em>for his own Sake</em>, that every <em>sensible Agent</em> pursues <em>Pleasure</em>, or Gratification; which therefore, in Strictness, should not be called <em>absolute</em>, but <em>relative</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Good: Especially since it is no other wise good, than as it suits his Faculties, and gratifies his Mind. For I can only consider Pleasure as a certain Modification of Mind resulting from the Agreement between Object and Faculty. We discover nothing more in it, than that it is grateful to us, or <em>good for us</em>. It cannot therefore, I think, be properly called an <em>absolute</em>, or <em>self-good</em>. Or if it may, yet it must be in another Sense, than what is meant by the absolute Goodness of <em>Virtue</em>. For in Virtue there is an <em>inherent Worth</em>, an <em>objective Perfection</em>. It is essentially good <em>in it self</em> and has no Dependance on any Agents, or any Fa<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Fa- [culties.] | culties.</span></span>culties. As such, it is upon its own Account, and <em>for its own Sake</em>, worthy to be chosen and pursued by moral Agents, who cannot but acknowledge and admire its intrinsick Excellence.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
It may also be questioned, whether <em>Pleasure</em> can, in Strictness, be called the <em>ultimate End</em> of a sensible Agent. Considered as <em>sensible</em>, he seems to be rather <em>himself</em> his own ultimate End. He pursues it for <em>his own Sake</em>, regards it always with reference <em>to himself</em>, and all his Views about it terminate <em>in himself</em>. However, in an <em>objective Sense</em>, it is manifestly his ultimate End; since he neither intends nor knows any Thing beyond it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But <em>Virtue</em> is the ultimate End of a <em>Moral</em> Agent, in the strictest Sense. As there is nothing beyond it to which it may be referred, but his View terminates in it; so he pursues it upon <em>its own Account</em>, and for <em>its own Sake</em>. In the Pursuit of <em>Pleasure</em>, <em>Self</em> is not only regarded, and included, but the Idea is perpetually uppermost. In the Pursuit of <em>Virtue</em>, <em>Self</em> is quite overlooked. A perfect moral Agent, unmindful of himself, keeps his Thoughts fixed on the Worth and Dignity of his Object. That is, he acts virtuously, not because it is <em>profitable</em>, or <em>pleasing</em>; but because it is, in it self, <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em> so to do.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I think it appears from the foregoing Considerations, that <em>Virtue</em> is the <em>ultimate End</em> of a Moral Agent, at least in a higher and stricter Sense, than <em>Pleasure</em> is of a <em>sensible</em> Agent. Even this, we see, cannot properly be said to be <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">be [<em>followed</em>] | <em>followed</em></span></span> <em>followed merely for its own Sake</em>. Much less can <em>subordinate Ends</em>, which are only pursued <em>for the sake</em> of the <em>Pleasure</em> which is produced of occasioned by them. <em>A Reason</em> may always be given for the Pursuit of them; and that Reason is <em>Gratification</em>. And it comes to the same Thing, whether we call them <em>Means</em>, or <em>subordinate Ends</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Thus, for Instance, why does any Man pursue <em>Fame</em>, or the Esteem and Praise of his Fellow-Creatures? Considered as a <em>sensible</em> Agent, the Reason is <em>Pleasure</em>; Nature having given him a Faculty for the Relish of such an Object, and thereby rendered it delightful to him. In respect of a <em>Moral</em> Agent, the Reason is its Subservience to Morality; as it gives more Room for the Exercise of his Virtues, and enables him to be more useful and beneficial.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be alledged, that we are led to the Pursuit of this, and other natural Objects, by an <em>instinctive Determination</em>, or <em>Affection</em>, antecedent to all <em>Reasons</em>, Views, or Designs, I readily grant it. But this very Instinct implies <em>Pleasure</em>, which always accompanies it, whether it be intended or no. And indeed without this, we could not have any <em>Affection</em> for any <em>Objects</em>; excepting such as are <em>self-eligible</em>, or <em>intrinsically</em> and <em>absolutely Good</em>. We may consider <em>Pleasure</em> as the Ligament which ties every <em>natural Affection</em> to its proper <em>Object</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Besides, as soon as we are capable of reflecting and exercising our Reason; instead of indulging such <em>Instincts</em> and cherish<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">cherish- [ing] | ing</span></span>ing such <em>Affections</em>, we should certainly check and resist them, if we neither found <em>Pleasure</em> in them, nor any <em>moral</em> Usefulness. Nothing but their Subservience to one or both of these <em>Ends</em>, could possibly induce us to continue the Pursuit of them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
Upon this Account I do not understand, how <em>Nature can recommend</em> any particular Objects to our Choice and Pursuit, any otherwise than by annexing <em>Pleasure</em> to the Perception of them. If they have no <em>absolute objective</em> Worth, they must have some <em>relative</em> Goodness: And what can this be but either <em>Pleasure</em>, or a Tendency thereto? That is, either immediate, or mediate; in Possession, or in Prospect.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
As various <em>Senses</em> are given us, both <em>external</em> and <em>internal</em>, for the Perception of <em>Pleasure</em>, or natural Good; so we have a Faculty of a higher Kind for the Perception of <em>Rectitude</em>, or moral Good. <em>Reason</em> or Intelligence, both discovers the Worth of this Object, and <em>recommends it to our Pursuit</em>. Reason cannot indeed inform us what Objects they are which gratify us, or are <em>good for us</em>; but it can discover Objects <em>good in themselves</em>, and recommend them accordingly.

And as to the third, if you say that such an Action would infer the Agent guilty of some Error, or false Conception; it is the very Thing to be proved. From the mere Idea of Pain, it no more follows that I ought not to give Pain, than from the Idea of Pleasure, that I ought not to give Pleasure. Thus Cruelty is not a Sign of Ignorance, or Error, but want of Sentiment.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. I would by no means found the Pravity or Obliquity of such an Action, on any <em>Error</em> of Judgment, or <em>false Conception</em>. Errors of Judgment, however they may justify or excuse what is <em>materially</em> wrong, can never constitute any Action immoral. But I found the Obliquity and Immorality of such Actions as we are speaking of, on their Con<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Con- [trariety] | trariety</span></span>trariety to the <em>Reasons of Things</em>, and the Violation of <em>Order</em> and <em>Truth</em>. And in this Respect they manifestly <em>thwart</em> that which is, or ought to be, the principal <em>End</em> of every moral Agent. Had we no <em>Sentiments</em> or <em>Instincts</em> at all, our Understandings would still shew us the Excellence and Self-worth of this End; and inform us, that we ought to pursue it for its own Sake.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;There is no more Occasion for a <em>Sentiment</em>, to make us discover, and approve of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>; than there is Occasion for a Sentiment to make us discover and assent to any kind of <em>Truth</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To <em>give Pain therefore</em>, without Cause, <em>to a sensible Creature</em>, must be <em>wrong</em>; because it is a Repugnance to Nature, and a Counteraction to Reason and Truth. From <em>the mere Idea of Pain</em> I infer nothing. But from the Relation or Disagreement, which I find between Pain and an innocent Sufferer, I infer the Unfitness of the Application. If <em>Pain</em> and <em>Pleasure</em> be equally suitable to the Nature of a <em>sensible</em> Creature, or if they appear so <em>in Idea</em>, to any Man who has felt both; then let it be allowed, that it is no more unreasonable to give the one, than the other. But if the contrary be true, the Consequence must prove accordingly.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If <em>Cruelty be want of Sentiment</em>, it is also a want of <em>Virtue</em>.

If a Man be so void of Com<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Com- [passion,] | passion,</span></span>passion, or so hard-hearted, that he cannot <em>feel</em> the <em>Inhumanity</em> of certain Actions; yet surely he may <em>understand</em> the <em>Unreasonableness</em> of them.

I answer, As far as that Difference affects my End proposed; or as far as the neglecting such a Difference may infer me guilty of some Error, they do so. But is I have no Sentiment of Good, my End can no way be affected by the Pleasure or Pain of a sensible Creature; and my giving him Pain, allowing no Sentiment, does not infer me guilty of any Error, more than my giving Pleasure would do.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. If a rational Agent <em>give Pain without Cause</em>, whatever his <em>Thoughts</em> maybe, his <em>Hands</em> are very erroneous. I mean, let a Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Ideas be never so clear, his <em>Will</em> is faulty, and his <em>Actions</em> wrong, if they run counter to the Reasons and Relations aforesaid. Nay, the clearer his <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">his [Ideas] | Ideas</span></span> Ideas are, the more blameable he is for not acting conformably to the Light which they give him. And indeed if such Reasons and Relations were not visible to him, he would not be guilty in a Moral Sense; since his Offence lies in acting contrary to his Judgment, and the Light of his own Mind. <em>Immorality</em> does not consist in the Errors of the <em>Understanding</em>, but the Rebellion of the <em>Will</em>. Neither does <em>Virtue</em> consist in clear Ideas, or just Apprehensions, but in chusing to do that which appears right. Whatever Light the Mind has been able to get, is Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s immediate Rule; and if he wills and acts conformably thereto, he is virtuous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Moral <em>Good</em> is not the Object of <em>Sentiment</em> or Sense, but of <em>Intelligence</em> only. Accordingly, every intelligent Agent is capable of perceiving it, and discovering the Worth of it. He finds it to be his true <em>End</em>, and that he cannot act in Opposition to it, without Consciousness of Guilt, and Self-condemnation. Hence it is that such Actions as we are speaking of, do not only <em>affect the End</em> of a moral Agent, but are directly repugnant to it, and inconsistent with it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If we have a <em>Sentiment of Good</em>, I suppose it is allowed that this Good becomes our <em>End</em>, and that this <em>End</em> is crossed and counteracted in <em>giving causeless Pain</em>. But why is not a <em>Rational Perception of Good</em> as useful and effectual as a <em>Sentiment?</em> If there be really such a thing as <em>intelligible Good</em>, why may it not be judged worthy of our Affection <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Affection [and] | and</span></span> and Pursuit? Certainly there may be valuable Objects that are out of the Reach of <em>Sense</em>. That we are not strictly <em>sensible</em> of such Objects cannot therefore be any Objection either against their Reality, or Worth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But the Truth is, there is so strong a Biass on the <em>sensible</em> Side of Human Nature, that not only our Affections, but our very Words and Ideas lean that way. Language is so far drawn aside, and the Signification of Terms so much warped towards us, that we are scarce able to distinguish between the <em>Rectum</em> and the <em>Utile</em>; or to conceive how any thing can be <em>good</em>, otherwise than as it is <em>useful</em> or <em>agreeable</em> to us. What more common than even for Moralists to define Good in general <em>relatively</em>, and to confound <em>absolute</em> Good and <em>intrinsick</em> Worth, with <em>Pleasure</em> and <em>Utility</em>. Hence it is, that in order to conceive <em>Moral Fitness</em>, they are apt to cast about, and consider what <em>Natural Ends</em> and Purposes it promotes, and what Benefits are to be reaped from it. This is, in Effect, either turning <em>Moral Fitness</em> into <em>Natural Fitness</em>, or representing <em>Virtue</em> as a mere Hand-maid to <em>Profit</em> and <em>Pleasure</em>.

<strong>Ans</strong>. <em>Virtue, without Sentiment</em>, is acting agreeably to the <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Relations</em> of Things. It is Conformity to <em>Order</em> and <em>Truth</em>. I before endeavoured to shew that <em>Moral Fitness</em> must needs be the Rule of all Rational Beings, and that the Deity Himself is eternally directed by it. I shall here add the following Consideration. The Author of the <em>Enquiry</em>, &<em>c</em>. supposes a certain<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Disposition essential to the Deity corresponding to the Affections He has given us</em>; and that He is continually influenced and determined by it in all his Proceedings.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If this be a true Idea of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Moral Perfection</em>; if He be constantly acted by a Principle of <em>Infinite Benevolence</em>, and have no other Regard to intrinsick <em>Order</em>, <em>Fitness</em>, <em>Rectitude</em>, than as conducing to the Production of <em>Natural Good</em>; it follows from thence, that he must at all Times, and in all Places, that is, from Eternity, and through all the Regions of infinite Space, have produced the very utmost Possibilities of <em>Natural Good</em>. He must have created, from everlasting, as many Worlds, and as many Creatures, as could possibly co-exist. He must have <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">have [given] | given</span></span> given all his Creatures the highest Talents and Perfections that were consistent with publick Interest, and the Advantage of the Whole. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> that <em>Scale of Beings</em>, which is partly discoverable at present, be most wonderfully regular and orderly, and therefore highly agreeable to the <em>Wisdom</em> and <em>Rectitude</em> of the Divine Nature; yet who can affirm, or even suppose, that the present Order and Constitution of the Universe, comprehends as much <em>Natural Good</em>, as infinite Power could possibly have produced?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Again, how shall we account, upon this Supposition, for the Introduction of <em>Evil</em>, either <em>Natural</em> or <em>Moral?</em> If Reason and Rectitude are out of the Question, what is the Meaning of these Hardships, Sufferings, and Distresses which infest Human Life? Are they the natural Consequences of Sin and Folly? Infinite Power might either prevent such Consequences, or have given us such a Frame as would have rendered us in capable of being affected by them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Besides, why are we not created impeccable? Why are we obnoxious to Sin and Folly? Why not made necessarily wise and good? Why were not invincible Propensities to Goodness planted in our Natures, for the Prevention of Evil both Natural and Moral? These, and many other Questions, are easy to be answered by those who acknowledge a Principle of <em>real Rectitude</em>, and <em>Moral Fitness</em>. But if we reject this Principle, and substitute in the room <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">room [of] | of</span></span> of it the benevolent <em>Disposition</em> before-mentioned; I am not able to conceive how these and the like Questions can admit of any satisfactory Answer.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I humbly suppose it essentially unfit, unbecoming the Supreme Being, and repugnant to his Nature, to produce Irregularity, Disorder, Confusion of any kind, whatever Advantage or Natural Good might possibly redound from thence to his Creatures, He has doubtless conferred upon them as great a Share of this Good as is consistent with absolute <em>Rectitude</em>, and intrinsick <em>Fitness</em>. But surely it is going too far to imagine that the Deity should sacrifice <em>Moral Good</em> to <em>Natural</em>. In this Sense, as I apprehend it, He ever primarily regards his own <em>Glory</em>, That is, <em>Truth</em>, <em>Order</em>, <em>Rectitude</em> are his own necessary and essential Perfections; which, morally speaking, He can no more violate, or counteract, than He can deny Himself. Accordingly, when he is said to <em>glorify</em> Himself, we ought, I think, to put this Construction upon it, and to consider Him as under a Moral Necessity of inviolably observing and maintaining his own glorious Attributes. And surely it must be highly just and fitting, that all intelligent Creatures pay him a suitable Homage, Compliance, and Submission.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to return. As far as <em>Natural Good</em>, and <em>Moral</em> are coincident, or whenever they are capable of being connected; in all such Cases there is no rooms for the foregoing Observations. But if there <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">there [might] | might</span></span> might possibly have been more <em>Natural Good</em> in the Universe than there is, which I know not how to avoid supposing, I humbly conceive it is to be accounted for in the Manner above-mentioned. I mean, that the Deity will not, and in a Moral Sense cannot, give up <em>absolute Good</em> for the sake of <em>relative Good</em>; nor act repugnantly to <em>Order</em> and <em>Truth</em>, for the <em>Benefit</em> of any Creatures, or any Consideration whatever. If this Conclusion be just, and likewise the Supposition from whence it is drawn; then we have here a full Proof not only of the <em>Reality</em>, but also of the <em>Supremacy</em> of that Principle, which I call <em>Rectitude</em>, or <em>Moral Fitness</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But whether that Supposition be just or no, the Reality of this Principle appears to me very evident, as I have endeavoured to shew, both in my former Papers, and in these. If the <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Relations</em> of Things be not real, and certain, our Understandings perpetually delude us, and what we call <em>Truth</em> is nothing but Fiction and Amusement. And if those <em>Relations</em> be real, they must needs constitute that <em>Moral Fitness</em>, from which our <em>Obligations</em> are plainly deducible, in the manner above-mentioned. This then is what I call <em>Virtue</em>, independent of all <em>Sentiments</em> and <em>Instincts</em>.

However general the Approbation of Goodness may be, many thinking and reasoning Men have <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">have [acknow-] | acknowledged</span></span> acknowledged they were at a Loss, when they would demonstrate the Obligation of any Part of Morality. Mr. Locke, who so well understood the Anatomy of Ideas, does not find any Principles of Morality necessarily included in our Moral Ideas. On the contrary, he leaves the whole Question of the Demonstration of the first Principles of Morality, as a Matter that might indeed be compassed, but which he did not undertake to give a thorough Account of. Nor need we be surprized at this, since the Understanding, and not the Sentiments, was the Subject of his Undertaking; and that excellent Philosopher was wholly taken up with intellectual Reflections. But Mr. Hutchinson seems to have supplied that Defect.

<strong>Ans</strong>. Had <em>Morality</em> been examined, studied and explained, with as much Care and Accuracy as some other Sciences have been, I doubt not but its main Principles had long ago been set in as clear a Light as any Propositions in <em>Euclid</em>. If <em>many thinking Men have been at a Loss</em> in demonstrating Moral Obli<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Obli- [gations,] | gations,</span></span>gations, I presume it may be accounted for, partly from what I have just now observed, and partly from their fixing of Morality on a wrong Foundation. This seems to have been the Case of Mr. <em>Locke</em> himself; who, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he performed excellently in most things, and set <em>Human Understanding</em> in a better and clearer Light than had ever been done before him, yet has not been able to exempt himself from the common Lot of Humanity. He has erred and misjudged sometimes; and perhaps no where more than in his <em>Moral</em> Notions, which he seems not to have considered and weighed with his usual Care and Exactness.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;He tells us,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>that the true Ground of Morality can only be the Will and the Law of God</em>. Elsewhere<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> he affirms, that <em>the Divine Law, or that Law which God has set to the Actions of Men, is the only true Touch-stone of Moral Rectitude</em>. If the <em>Will of God be the true Ground of Morality</em>, I ask, what is the <em>true Ground</em> of his own Moral Perfections? Most certainly they are not <em>groundless</em>. And it is equally certain, that his <em>Will</em> can be no Law to Himself; since upon that Supposition He would be <em>arbitrary</em> in all his Proceedings. Whatever be the <em>true Ground</em> of Moral Goodness in the Deity, must also be the true Ground of the Moral Goodness of his Creatures; since His Goodness and theirs, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> infinitely different in <em>Degree</em>, must needs be of the same <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">same [<em>Kind</em>.] | <em>Kind</em>.</span></span> <em>Kind</em>. Except therefore we suppose the Conduct of the Deity either <em>necessary</em> or <em>arbitrary</em>, we must allow it to be founded on <em>Moral Fitness</em>, and the <em>Reasons of Things</em>. And by Consequence, the Moral Goodness of his Creatures must unavoidably stand upon the same Foundation.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
I beg leave to observe upon this Occasion, that I have often wondered to find Mr. <em>Locke</em>, as well as other Authors, perpetually confounding <em>Moral Virtue</em> and <em>Religion</em>. It is manifest that <em>Religion</em> is immediately founded on the <em>Divine Will</em>, which is the true Rule of all <em>Religious</em> Agents. But if we consider Men as <em>Moral</em> Agents, their true and immediate Rule is <em>Moral Fitness</em>, or those <em>Reasons of Things</em>, by which the Will of God Himself is eternally directed. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> therefore <em>Religion</em> and <em>Moral Goodness</em> may be looked upon as coincident, both in respect of their ultimate Ground, and the Agreement of their Precepts; yet upon several Accounts we ought not to confound these Ideas, which are in themselves distinct. The Deity is incapable of <em>Religion</em>, but in all <em>Moral Goodness</em> is infinitely perfect. As to Man, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it must be allowed, that those Actions of his which flow from a Regard to <em>Right Reason</em>, and the Love of <em>Virtue</em>, are the purest and most perfect of which he is capable; yet he stands in great need of <em>Religion</em>, as being too corrupt, and too headstrong to be guided by the intellectual Reins of <em>Reason</em>, and <em>Moral Rectitude</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Rectitude</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; [For] | For</span></span> For a long time Tryal was made of a great Part of Mankind, how far this Principle would prevail, and what Regard would be shewn to the Rules and Dictates of natural Reason. But the Generality of the World were so far from observing them, that they had almost effaced them. God was pleased therefore to reinforce <em>Virtue</em> with <em>Religion</em>; to give Men new Light, and new Laws, and to strengthen those Laws by powerful Sanctions. I grant indeed, that before this the Heathens were under <em>Religious</em> as well as <em>Moral</em> Obligations. But through their own Folly and Negligence, they seem to have understood very little of <em>Natural Religion</em>. They rarely considered Virtue as the Will and Law of God; or any otherwise than as the Voice of Nature, and the Suggestion of Right Reason.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever Pre-eminence may be due to Virtue, on account of its intrinsick Excellence and Dignity, yet the Authority and Majesty of Religion seem much fitter, and more effectual to restrain licentious Men, and govern a degenerate World. Those purer Beings, which are of an Order superior to Human Nature, need not perhaps any other Rule than that internal one of <em>Reason</em> or <em>Virtue:</em> But our frail and faulty Species wants both another Law, and a Legislator, to curb their Follies and Vices, and keep them in some measure within the Bounds of their Duty.

To return to Mr. <em>Locke:</em> The following Passage plainly informs us what he thought of the Demonstrability of moral Principles. <em>I doubt not</em>, says<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> he, <em>but from self-evident Propositions, by necessary Consequences as incontestible as those in Mathematicks, the Measures of Right and Wrong might be made out, to any one that will apply himself with the same Indifference and Attention to the one, as he does to the other of these Sciences. The Relation of other Modes may certainly be perceived, as well as those of Number and Extension: And I cannot see why they should not also be capable of Demonstration, if due Methods were thought on to examine, or pursue their Agreement or Disagreement</em>. Had Mr. <em>Locke</em> fixed Morality on its true Foundation, he would have been still further satisfied about this Matter; and have discovered more fully the Justness of these Observations. Those <em>Relations</em> of Agreement and Disagreement between Agents, Actions and Object, which constitute <em>Right</em> and <em>Wrong</em>, are much more obvious than some others which he examined and explained in the most accurate Manner: And how he happened to overlook them, I cannot take upon me to determine. But he tells us himself,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that supposing his <em>Rule erroneous</em>,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>he is not mistaken in the Relation which Actions bear to that Rule be, compares them to, which is Agreement, or Disagreement</em>.

The foregoing Passages plainly shew, if I mistake not, that Mr. <em>Locke</em> looked upon <em>the Principles of Morality as necessarily included</em>, some way or other, <em>in our Ideas</em>. But it must be confessed, that he does not always express himself conformably to such an Opinion, or his Declarations above cited. For how shall we reconcile herewith, his denying<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> any <em>practical Principles to be self-evident?</em> If no practical Principles be self-evident, I see no Possibility of reducing Morality to Demonstration; every Demonstration being only a Chain of self-evident Propositions. I am so far from thinking <em>no practical Principles to be self-evident</em>, that I look upon them all as either self-evident, or reducible to self-evident Propositions. How our <em>Obligations</em> are connected with <em>Moral Fitness</em>, and the <em>Reasons of Things</em>, has been already shewn. Now in all ordinary Cases, that is, in all Cases where the <em>Relations</em> above-mentioned are visible to us; that <em>Moral Fitness</em> is either immediately self-evident, as in <em>simple</em> Duties; or demonstrable, as in <em>complex</em> ones. This Self-evidence I have before had Occasion to consider in some Instances, and may perhaps have further Occasion hereafter. However, it may not be improper to produce one more in this Place.

No Reasons can be assigned for either, but such as are <em>Identical</em>. If a Man have a false Conception of the Deity, in respect of that Man the Proposition may want Evidence or Proof; but otherwise, it has all the Evidence, and all the Light that any Principle can have. Between the Ideas of the Agent, and the Action on one Hand, and the Idea of an all-perfect Object on the other Hand; the Relation of <em>Fitness</em> or Congruity is as manifest, as the Relation of Equality between <em>twice Three</em>, and <em>Six</em>. On the contrary, a <em>cubical Inch</em> may as well be imagined commensurate to <em>infinite Space</em>, as <em>irreverent</em> Thoughts, Words or Actions, be apprehended suitable from <em>Man</em> towards his <em>Maker</em>. There is equally, in both Cases, an essential and everlasting Repugnance to the Truth and Natures of Things, immediately visible to every Understanding. And the same Observation might be carried on through a great Number of Moral Principles, in which is to be found the like immediate Agreement or Disagreement.

If it be true, that Mr. <em>Locke</em> did not place Moral Virtue on its proper Foundation; I can by no Means think, that Mr. <em>Hutchinson</em> has supplied that Defect. So far from it, that it seems to me much better to found it as Mr. <em>Locke</em> does, than to fix it upon <em>Instincts</em>. The <em>Will</em> of the Deity, which is Mr. <em>Locke</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Foundation, is the true Ground, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ground, [if] | if</span></span> if not of <em>Moral Virtue</em>, yet of <em>Religion</em>. But <em>Instincts</em> cannot, I think, be essential to either. In several other Respects Morality is indebted to Mr. <em>Hutchinson</em>; but in this I presume he has injured it: Though certainly without the least Intention of so doing. In short, the more I consider it, the more I am convinced, that nothing can support <em>Virtue</em>, either honourably or securely, but <em>Truth</em> and <em>Right Reason</em>.

<strong>Art</strong>. XVII. What you call <em>Moral Perception</em>, can be nothing else but Mr. <em>Hutchinson</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Moral Sense</em>. The Agreements and Disagreements of Moral Actions are allowed on both Sides to be very apparent. But that a Power of perceiving such Agreements and Disagreements ought to be called a Sense, or Sentiment, I think is very manifest. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. What Mr. <em>Hutchinson</em> means, or seems to mean, by his <em>Moral Sense</em>, I considered, and endeavoured to shew in my former Papers. What I mean by <em>Moral Perception</em>, if it do not already, sufficiently appear, shall be here further explained.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Moral Perception</em>, considered <em>objectively</em>, is the Agreement or Disagreement of Moral Ideas. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ideas. [Considered] | Considered</span></span> Considered <em>in it self</em>, it is an Operation of that Power, or Faculty of the Mind, by which we are enabled to perceive such Agreements or Disagreements. Such <em>Truth</em>, in general, consists in the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas, and is the Object only of that Faculty which we call <em>Understanding</em>; I therefore conclude, that <em>Moral Perception</em> differs from <em>Intellectual</em>, no otherwise than as any <em>Species</em> differs from its <em>Genus</em>. <em>Moral Rectitude</em> is a Species of <em>Truth</em>, and therefore strictly <em>intelligible</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I am not able to discover the least Reason why <em>Moral Perceptions</em> should not be ascribed to the <em>Understanding</em> as well as <em>Mathematical</em> ones. Of the two, <em>Moral Perceptions</em> may seem more <em>intellectual</em> than the other; <em>Figures</em> are properly Objects of <em>Imagination</em>, however they may be improved and perfected by the <em>Understanding</em>. Some indeed are so very much compounded, that we cannot <em>imagine</em> them; or but very imperfectly. Their Sides and Angles are so numerous, that the <em>Imagination</em> cannot grasp them; but is forced to borrow the Assistance of the <em>Understanding</em>. However, such <em>Figures</em> are <em>Images</em>, though our <em>Imaginations</em> be too narrow to receive them. But <em>Virtues</em> and <em>Vices</em>, <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Relations</em> are, in themselves, utterly <em>unimaginable</em>; and therefore no Objects of such a Faculty, however capacious.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> any one has a mind to call that Faculty, by which we perceive <em>Moral</em> Agreements and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [Dis-] | Disagreements,</span></span>Disagreements, an <em>internal Sense</em>; I am very unwilling to dispute about Words. But then, if he be consistent with himself, he must give the same Name to that Faculty, by which we perceive <em>Physical</em>, or <em>Mathematical</em> Agreements. That is, he must call <em>Intelligence</em> an <em>internal Sense</em>. Whatever it be called, the thing which I contend for is, that we perceive <em>Moral</em> Relations by the same Faculty that we perceive any other Relations. That as <em>Truth</em> in general is the Object of that Faculty which is commonly called the <em>Understanding</em>; so <em>Moral Rectitude</em> is a Species of <em>Truth</em>, and therefore only <em>intelligible</em>. To represent Truth, of any Kind, as an Object of any other Faculty, than that of <em>Understanding</em>, tends, I think, to introduce the utmost Confusion both in our Words and Ideas.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Every</strong> one will allow, in respect of our <em>external Senses</em>, that they are very distinct from, the <em>Understanding</em>; as being indeed only ministerial to it, and supplying it with Materials for Thought and Reflection. There is evidently as much Difference between them, as between an <em>Architect</em>, and the <em>Labourers</em> employed under him. But the Question is, whether we have not also other Senses of a superior Kind. Let a Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Understanding</em> be never so good, and his external Sense of <em>Hearing</em> never so quick, he may still want an <em>Ear</em> for <em>Musick</em>. In like manner, though his <em>Understanding</em> and <em>Sight</em> be both good, he <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">he [may] | may</span></span> may nevertheless want an <em>Eye</em> for <em>Paintings</em>, for <em>Statues</em>, for <em>Buildings</em>. Hence the Author of the <em>Inquiry</em>, &c. plausibly concludes in favour of <em>Internal Senses</em>. Allowing then his Conclusion to be just; nothing, I think, can be inferred from hence, but that such Persons are incapable of relishing such Objects, or tasting the <em>Pleasure</em> which they produce in the Minds of others. It will by no means follow, that <em>Moral</em>, or any other <em>intellectual</em> Perceptions may be ascribed to any such <em>internal Sense</em>. For however such a <em>Sense</em> may affect the Mind, or raise in it a Pleasure which it would otherwise want; yet it can go no further. It communicates to it no Agreements or Disagreements, but those of the Object with it self. The <em>Relations</em> of Things themselves are out of its Reach.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If <em>Truth</em> be not the proper Object of the <em>Understanding</em>; we either have no such Faculty, or that Faculty is without an Object. If then <em>Moral Rectitude</em> be one kind of <em>Truth</em>, it must be the Object of <em>Intelligence</em> only. And if it be not one kind of <em>Truth</em>, we must find out something else to constitute Truth, besides the <em>Agreement of Ideas</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> it be urged, that this is equally applicable to <em>Beauty</em> and <em>Harmony</em>, which consist: also in the Agreements and Proportions of Ideas; I answer, that such Agreements either really intercede between the Objects themselves, or they are only arbitrary Accommodations <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Accommodations [to] | to</span></span> to their respective Faculties. If they really intercede between the Ideas themselves, they are only <em>intelligible</em>, and not the Objects of any <em>Sense</em>. If the Agreement be only between the <em>Faculty</em> and the <em>Object</em>, it then amounts to nothing more than a <em>sensible</em> Perception.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I must explain my self by Instances. Between the Number 2, 8, 32, there is a real Agreement of <em>Proportion</em>; and between the <em>Three Angles of an equilateral Triangle</em>, a real Agreement of <em>Equality</em>. Such Agreements essentially belong to the Ideas themselves, in dependently of the Faculty, and even of the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Will. This is, in the most proper Sense, <em>Truth</em>; absolute, objective Truth; and as such, can only be the Object of <em>Intelligence</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Between a certain kind of <em>Food</em>, and a Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Palate</em>, between a certain <em>Prospect</em>, and his <em>Eye</em>; between a certain Combination of <em>Sounds</em>, and his <em>Ear</em>; there is only an arbitrary Agreement of the Object with the Faculty. For whatever <em>real Order</em>, or <em>Proportion</em> there may be among the several Parts of complex sensible Objects; these, like all other Relations, can only be apprehended by the <em>Understanding</em>. <em>Sense</em> judges of nothing but its own <em>Sensations</em>. Hence we find an endless Variety in Mens <em>Tastes</em> and <em>Fancies</em>, but not in their <em>Understandings</em>. I mean, in respect of such Truths as we have been considering. The Agreements between the <em>Numbers</em> and <em>Angles</em> above-mentioned, appear uniformly and universally the same, to all Beings capable <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">capable [of] | of</span></span> of understanding them. And the same may be said of the Agreement between <em>Benefits</em> and <em>Gratitude</em>, and other <em>Moral</em> Truths. In all such Cases the Agreements are not <em>relative</em>, but <em>real</em>, as being inherent in the Ideas themselves. A Power of perceiving these <em>real</em> Agreements, I call <em>Intelligence</em>; a Power of perceiving the other, <em>Sense</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> <em>a Power of perceiving</em> real <em>Agreements ought to be called a Sense, or Sentiment</em>; what Partition, what Boundaries will remain between <em>Sense</em> and <em>Intelligence?</em> Why should we confound the Terms, if the Things signified by them be really different? And that they are different, widely different, in several Respects, is, with me, out of all Question. It may be sufficient to observe at present, that every <em>Sensation</em> is a <em>Modification</em> of the Mind it self, which is really affected by it, according to the Nature of the Sense, and the Object, and the Degree of the Sensation. The Mind is hereby put, as it were, into a new State. But <em>intellectual Perception</em>, considered as such, does not thus affect the Mind, or give it any new <em>Modification</em>. It only shews it what its Objects are in themselves; wherein they agree with, or differ from each other. Both <em>Sense</em> and <em>Intelligence</em> consist in a Power of <em>Perception</em>; and both the Powers are <em>passive</em>. But I know of no other Resemblance between them. <em>Sense</em> furnishes the Mind with its Ideas: But can Sense <em>examine</em> and <em>compare</em> these Ideas? Can it perceive any <em>Relations</em> be<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">be- [tween] | tween</span></span>tween them? Can it proceed to <em>Disposition</em>, <em>Division</em>, <em>Abstraction</em>, <em>Composition?</em> Can it discover <em>Causes, Effects, Connexions, Consequences?</em> If any <em>Sense</em> be capable of <em>Moral Perceptions</em>, then it may be capable of these and the like intellectual Functions. And if so, what Occasion have we for that Faculty which we call <em>Intelligence?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only observe further, that <em>Brutes</em> have various <em>Senses</em>; both external, and perhaps internal. They have likewise various <em>Instincts</em>, <em>Propensities</em>, and <em>Pre-sensations</em>. But, if I mistake not, they have not the least Degree of <em>Intelligenc</em>-[???]. They cannot, I presume, perceive any <em>Relations</em>; and are therefore utterly incapable of <em>Knowledge</em>. We do not discover that they have any Power at all over their own Ideas; much less, that they are capable of any of the forementioned Operations. They seem constantly and uniformly to follow the Direction of their several <em>Instincts</em>, and every Species observes its own Track. If these Suppositions be true, as I am persuaded they are, they not only ascertain the Distinction between <em>Sensibility</em> and <em>Intelligence</em>, but may serve to convince us of the Use and Importance of such a Distinction.

<strong>Art</strong>. XVIII. Obligation can certainly be no simple Idea. If then it be properly an Object of the Understanding, what are the Ideas whereof it is <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">is [compounded?] | compounded?</span></span> compounded? This Moral Perception, whereby the Reasonableness of Goodness and Gratitude appears so clearly, is no doubt something distinct: from the Ideas themselves of Gratitude and Goodness. I cannot find that any sort of Obligation is included merely in those Ideas. Besides, this Moral Perception must not only be an Idea, whether Simple or Compound, but it must comprehend some Proposition, or Affirmation; as that a Man ought to be grateful, or that he ought to desire the Good of others. But I do not see any such Propositions as these included in those Ideas.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. The Substance of this Article has been so largely considered under the Numbers 4, 5, and 6, that I shall need to add very little here. <em>Obligation</em> maybe considered as an Attachment of the Mind to some <em>Object</em> which appears <em>Self-eligible</em>. Such an Object necessarily produces Approbation and Affection in the Mind of the Perceiver; who is thereby continually prompted to pursue it. Whenever he has it in View, he unavoidably perceives an Inducement, a Motive, a Reason for the Choice of it; and that in Pro<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Pro- [portion] | portion</span></span>portion to the Worth and Dignity of the Object. This Power, or Fitness, which it has to work upon his <em>Will</em>; is what brings his Mind into that State which I call <em>Obligation</em>. Thus, considered as a <em>sensible</em> Agent, he is <em>obliged</em> to pursue <em>Pleasure</em>; as a <em>Moral</em> Agent, <em>Virtue</em>. In both Cases the Mind is <em>drawn</em>, but not <em>driven</em>; that is, <em>obliged</em>, but not <em>compelled</em>. Every Sollicitation of Sense, not injurious to animal Life, would be really <em>obligatory</em>, if not over-ruled by some superior <em>Motive</em>, some stronger <em>Obligation</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It is very true that Obligation must be <em>something distinct from the Ideas of Gratitude and Goodness</em>. As distinct as any <em>Effect</em> is from its <em>Cause</em>. <em>Obligation</em> is not <em>Virtue</em>, or Moral Rectitude, but the Effect produced in the Mind by the Influence and Operation of that excellent Object.

For by this Faculty we not only may, but must <em>approve a certain End</em>. And that such an End, if I mistake not, as cannot possibly be perceived by any <em>Sense</em>. That <em>absolute Good</em>, that <em>objective Perfection</em> which is to be found in <em>Virtue</em>, or Moral Rectitude, is to be apprehended by no other Faculty than that of <em>Understanding</em>. But supposing it the Object of a <em>Moral Sentiment</em>, how is <em>the Reasonableness of Morality</em>, or consequent <em>Obligation</em> more <em>easily deduced</em>, this way than the other? Will Conformity to a certain <em>Sense</em> render any thing more <em>reasonable</em> than Conformity to the <em>Understanding?</em> Certainly nothing can be more reasonable than that which <em>Reason</em> it self approves. And as to <em>Obligation</em>, that is proportionable to the Worth and Weight of the <em>Motive</em>, or the Dignity of the <em>End</em> in view, by whatever Faculty it be perceived[.]&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;By the <em>Comparison of Ideas</em>, and the <em>Relations</em> belonging to them, we plainly discover how such an <em>Action</em> is fit for such an <em>Agent</em>, towards such an <em>Object</em>. And how <em>Obligation</em> follows from hence, and is connected with <em>Moral Fitness</em>, has been shewn before.

You say, if there be a Moral Rectitude, you doubt not <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">not [but] | but</span></span> but our Understandings are capable of perceiving it.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. If that Faculty, by which we judge of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>, be really a <em>Sense</em>; and that Sense distinct from Intelligence; I cannot comprehend how our <em>Understandings</em> are any way concerned in such Perceptions. At least, I cannot see that there is any Occasion for them. <em>Moral Rectitude</em> is <em>Truth</em>; and if <em>Truth</em> be an Object of any <em>Sense</em>, and that Sense in our Possession, the <em>Understanding</em>, which has no other Object than Truth, must needs be concluded either an useless, or at least a supernumerary Faculty. For if such a <em>Sense</em> be sufficient for the Purposes of <em>Morality</em>, it may well be allowed sufficient for inferior Sciences. <em>Moral Rectitude</em> is not only <em>Truth</em>, but the noblest, and most important Branch of it. And from hence it seems to follow very plainly, that if our <em>intelligent</em> Faculty be not concerned here, it is concerned no where.

He does so, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">so, [and] | and</span></span> and the Nature of the Thing requires it. It is also on this Account, that it is agreeable to Reason. For upon these Principles the Reasonableness of Morality may be demonstrated.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. Why is any Moral Action <em>right?</em> And why does the Mind <em>approve</em> it as such? According to Mr. <em>Hutchinson</em>, the Answers are, Because such an Action is agreeable to an implanted <em>Affection</em>, and appears conformable to the <em>Moral Sense</em>. If this Scheme be true, it seems to me that nothing in Morality is capable of being <em>demonstrated</em>, I have no other Idea of <em>Demonstration</em>, but that of shewing how one thing <em>necessarily</em> follows from another, and is essentially connected with it. But what room is there for this in <em>Morality</em> on Mr. <em>Hutchinson</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Principles? Such an Action agrees not with my <em>Taste</em>; or is repugnant to my <em>Moral Sense</em>. What does this prove? Nothing more than that the Action appears <em>wrong</em> to me. It is so far from proving it to be wrong in itself, that it does not prove the Action must have such an Appearance to any other Person. Another Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Moral Sense</em> may possibly be quite different from mine. And either his or mine may possibly be altered the next Minute. The bare Possibility of this, is an effectual Bar to such a Proof.

<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Proof [<strong>But</strong>.] | <strong>But</strong></span></span> 
<strong>But</strong> will not that <em>Disposition</em>, and that Principle in the Deity, which are supposed to correspond to our <em>Natural Affections</em>, and <em>Moral Sense</em>, certainly incline him universally to communicate and continue the same <em>Sense</em> to all rational Agents? I answer, That this being the Ground or Foundation of the supposed Demonstration here spoken of, must it self be antecedently proved: Otherwise, whatever is built upon it, or deduced from it, must be precarious and uncertain. Now there is no Way to secure this Fundamental Point, but by shewing that such a <em>Disposition</em> in the Deity is strictly <em>necessary</em>. And this, I presume, is not possible to be shewn. To suppose the Benevolence of the Deity strictly necessary, is to resolve all his Proceedings and Dispensations into absolute <em>Fatality</em>. On this Supposition his Favours and Bounties are not any Favours at all, but necessary and unavoidable Communications. And the Consequence of this would be, that the greatest Blessings in the World would lay us under no Obligation at all. The <em>necessary Benevolence</em> of the Deity, is therefore so far from being <em>demonstrable</em>, that it is an utter Impossibility. Thus I think it appears, that whoever undertakes to demonstrate Morality by the sole Principle of <em>Sense</em>, or <em>Sentiment</em>, is so far from being able to succeed, that he has no Ground to stand upon, no Place to set his Foot.

<strong>If</strong> Morality was founded on <em>Instincts</em>, we could no more demonstrate the intrinsick Preferableness of one <em>Action</em> to another, than that of one <em>Colour</em> to another. Every Agent would know, or, to speak more properly, would be <em>sensible</em>, which Actions pleased him, and which displeased him; but in themselves they would be all equally valuable, or rather equally worthless.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> are not those Actions <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em>, which conduce to the <em>End</em> proposed by the Agent? In this respect I allow they are. But this is only a <em>relative</em>, extrinsick <em>Rectitude</em>. The procuring of a rich Perfume, or a fine Prospect, is <em>right</em> and reasonable in the same Sense, Certainly nothing of this kind can deserve the Name of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Actions</strong> <em>relatively right</em>, that is conducing to some End of the Agent, may not only want <em>Moral</em>, but even <em>Natural Rectitude</em>. Thus when, with some View of private Interest, a <em>Mechanick</em> departs from the Truth and Regularity of Workmanship; or an <em>Architect</em> transgresses the Rules of Order and Proportion, however their Actions may conduce to the proposed <em>End</em>, they are neither right according to <em>Art</em>, nor <em>Nature</em>. Whatever they may be in a <em>relative</em> Sense, they are <em>absolutely</em> and intrinsically <em>wrong</em>. Works of Art are more or less perfect in Proportion to their <em>Conformity</em> to <em>Truth</em>. And this <em>Conformity to Truth</em>, when carried on to Life and Manners, commences <em>Moral Rectitude</em>. I <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">I [need] | need</span></span> need not observe, how much more important those Actions must be, which are directed to <em>sensible</em> and <em>intelligent</em> Objects, than those which are directed to <em>inanimate</em> ones. The <em>Relations</em> interceding between <em>Mind</em> and <em>Mind</em>, must needs be of great Weight and Moment, and that Moment be increased in Proportion to the Dignity of the <em>Agent</em> and <em>Object</em>. But it may not be improper to take notice, that Communication of <em>Natural Good</em>, is by no means an essential Ingredient of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If no Natural End, if the Happiness of no Being whatever could possibly be promoted by it, it would still be the Duty of every intelligent Creature to reverence and worship the Deity. What is it then that makes such an Action reasonable in such a Circumstance? Or upon what Account is the Agent obliged to perform it? On Account of its inherent, essential <em>Fitness</em>, which cannot be disregarded without a gross Violation of <em>Order</em> and <em>Truth</em>. The Supremacy, and infinite Perfection of such an Object infinitely heightens that <em>Fitness</em>, and makes it in the highest Degree <em>reasonable</em>, even supposing no Advantage did or could redound from it to any Agent whatever. And hence, I think, it plainly appears, that <em>Moral Rectitude</em>, considered abstractedly from all other Views, is it self the true and ultimate End of all Rational Beings.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. I should think this Foundation <em>dishonourable</em>, whether it were <em>variable</em> or no. But <em>variable</em> it must be, if it may at any time be <em>varied</em>. And I have shewn, that there is nothing to hinder such a Variation, unless these <em>Instincts</em> depend on the forementioned <em>Disposition</em> in the Deity, and that <em>Disposition</em> be strictly <em>necessary</em>. Which latter Supposition is attended with such absurd and shocking Consequences, as render it altogether incredible, and indeed impossible, What is there then to secure a Continuance of these supposed <em>Instincts?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Were it the Will of the Supreme Agent supposed to be influenced and directed by the <em>Reason of Things</em>, then indeed these <em>Instincts</em> might be looked upon as stable and secure; or at least they would certainly be never <em>varied</em> or removed, while the Reasons for the Continuance lasted. But that is not supposed, nor allowed; and indeed if it were, it would be wholly needless to seek for any other Foundation for Virtue. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Virtue.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> it may deserve to be considered, whether they be not also <em>variable</em> in another Respect. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> all Men be naturally endued with some Degrees of <em>Humanity</em> and <em>Benevolence</em>; yet through a corrupt Education, and vicious Habits, may not those <em>Sentiments</em> be in a great measure effaced, and even contrary ones imbibed? May not Compassion be turned into Cruelty, Benevolence into Barbarity, Human Affections into Brutal ones. If we examine the Conduct of such Men-Monsters as Nero, and <em>Caligula</em>, what Remains, what Traces shall we find either of <em>Natural Affection</em>,<em></em> or of the <em>Moral Sense?</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>According</strong> to my Principle, (which I only call mine because I have embraced and defended it) the <em>Foundation</em> of <em>Virtue</em> ever remains firm and unshaken, whatever Mens Conduct or Practices may be. The <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Relations</em> of Things are essential and unalterable. <em>Moral Rectitude</em> therefore must be perpetually the same, if grounded thereon. But if <em>Natural Instincts</em> be its only Support, and Men have it in their Power to get rid of such Instincts; whenever this is done, it may be said in respect to those Men, that <em>Virtue</em> is not only broken down, but its very <em>Foundations</em> overturned.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the <em>Reasons of things</em> be unchangeable, yet is not our <em>Faculty of Reason</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Reason</em> [capable] | capable</span></span> capable of being changed and corrupted? May not our Understandings be vitiated, and our Judgments distorted? Doubtless they may, in some measure. But while a Man is <em>compos mentis</em>, his Reason can never be destroyed, or its Perceptions inverted. In spite of all his Arts and Evasions, a vicious Man must be forced, in many Cases, to perceive Things to be, not as he would have them, but as they really are. However he may have hardened his <em>Heart</em>, or lost his <em>Feeling</em>, he can never quite blind his <em>Judgment</em>, or extinguish the Light of his <em>Understanding</em>. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we suppose him entirely divested of Compassion, and wrought up to such a Pitch of Fierceness and Brutality, as to be greatly delighted with cruel Actions, yet it will not always be in his Power to make such Actions appear <em>right</em>, and <em>reasonable</em>, even to himself. <em>Truth</em> will sometimes break in upon his Mind, whatever Care he may take to guard against it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short, let a Men be never so profligate, this <em>Rational Principle</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it may be much weakened in him, can never be destroyed. However its Fruits are blasted, or its Branches withered, still it lives, and cannot be quite killed. But in all Appearance, a <em>Virtue</em> merely <em>instinctive</em>, may be plucked up by the very Roots.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. Such a <em>Foundation of Virtue</em> seems to me <em>dishonourable</em>, because it takes away the <em>Merit</em> of virtuous Actions. For how can any Action be <em>meritorious</em>, to which the Agent is determined by the Force of a mere <em>Impulse?</em> By such a Weight the Mind is drawn, as it were, mechanically; and as far as that is the Case, I can see no more Moral <em>Worth</em> in the Actions thereby produced, than in the Movements of a Clock, or the Vibrations of a Pendulum. Besides, Reason is hereby placed in Subordination to inferior Powers and Principles; and such as Brutes themselves are possessed of. Nor is any other Employment allotted it, than that of being ministerial to <em>Instinct</em>, and contriving Means for the gratifying of a Natural Inclination.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The <em>Universality</em> of a <em>Moral Affection</em>, and a <em>Moral Sense</em>, does not remove the Imputation we are speaking of. <em>Hunger</em> and <em>Thirst</em> are <em>universal Instincts</em>; but however suitable they may be to our present Condition, they are never reckoned <em>honourable</em> to Human Nature.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Undoubtedly Men may contract such Dispositions and Habits as are contrary to Nature; and in respect of the pre<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">pre- [sent] | sent</span></span>sent Constitution of Mankind, such Dispositions may be called <em>Disorders</em>. But in strictness, if there be real <em>Order</em> in Things and Actions, there can be no real <em>Disorder</em>. However, if Virtue be founded on <em>Instinct</em>, and according to the foregoing Supposition, this Instinct may possibly be worn out, and a contrary Affection acquired; in this Case the Agent has changed his <em>End</em>, and those Actions must be reputed <em>reasonable</em> which conduce to this new End. He still acts conformably to a prevailing <em>Sentiment</em>, and pursues the Bias of his corrupt Nature; and if <em>Reason</em> and <em>Moral Rectitude</em> be thrown out of the Question, who can convict him of doing wrong?

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. I have been obliged to anticipate this Article; and therefore shall not need to answer it at large. <em>The Works of the Creation</em> do indeed plainly discover to us the infinite <em>Goodness</em> of the Creator. But this <em>Goodness</em> is, I humbly presume, grounded on <em>Reason</em> and <em>Moral Fitness</em>, and upon that very Account is <em>eternal and unchangeable</em>. It could <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">could [not] | not</span></span> not be so upon any other Supposition, excepting that of absolute <em>Necessity</em>, which, as I before observed, is utterly inconsistent with Moral Perfection. What Idea can we have of any <em>Goodness</em>, but that which is <em>free?</em> Or of any <em>Bounty</em>, but that which is <em>willed</em> and <em>designed?</em> We receive great Advantages from the <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>; but can they therefore be properly called our <em>Benefactors?</em> Or are they, in any Degree, meritorious upon that Account? Supposing them <em>intelligent</em>, there would be nothing laudable, nothing praise worthy in their Communications of Light; if that Light were only a necessary Emanation. And the same may be said of the divine Benignity, which overflows the World, and fills the whole Universe. If it were not in God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Power to with-hold his Gifts, they would not really be Gifts; and however good they might be in a <em>natural</em> Sense, it would be impossible to understand how the Author of them could be accounted good in a <em>Moral</em> Sense. In short, to suppose any Moral Actions necessary, is to make a contradictory Supposition. For if they were <em>necessary</em>, they could not be <em>Actions</em>, much less <em>Moral</em> ones.

For the Choice of <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">of [Ends] | Ends</span></span> Ends is no way a Matter of Reason. But I think this Objection may be very well retorted. For without supposing such a Sentiment, I can find no Reason for ever preferring one Action to another.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. <em>Ends</em> are either <em>Ultimate</em> or <em>Subordinate</em>. <em>Ultimate Ends</em> determine themselves, as being necessarily approved. The ultimate End of the Deity in all his Acts of Creation and Providence, I humbly suppose to be <em>Moral Good</em>. Every Thing is to be referred to this, and resolved into it. Why did he at first produce the Universe? Why does he still preserve and cherish, it? Why replenish it continually with Variety of Good? Because he sees it to be absolutely <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em> so to do. Or in other Words, because the purest and most perfect <em>Reason</em> directs him to it. Though therefore <em>Reason</em>, or <em>Intelligence</em>, considered as an Attribute, do not make this <em>End</em>; yet it discovers it to be, what it really is in it self, an <em>absolute</em>, <em>essential</em>, and <em>necessary Good</em>; and by Consequence, the true ultimate End not only of the supreme Being, but of every Moral Agent.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;We are so immersed in the Enjoyments and Desires of <em>Natural Good</em>, that the Ideas of Pleasure and Profit are continually obtruding themselves upon us; even in these Enquiries where they <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">they [have] | have</span></span> have no Concern. It seems evident to me, that making <em>Pleasure</em> of any Kind the <em>End</em> of a <em>Moral Agent</em>, is as absurd, as making <em>Truth</em> or <em>Virtue</em> the <em>End</em> of a <em>sensible Agent</em>. What a <em>Moral Agent</em> primarily proposes, is to act <em>reasonably</em>; let the Consequence be as it may. If it be asked, why a <em>Moral Agent</em> proposes to act <em>reasonably</em>; then I ask, why a <em>sensible Agent</em> proposes to act <em>pleasurably?</em> Our Faculty of <em>Reason</em> does not constitute the one a Good; but perceives it to be such. Our Faculties of <em>Sense</em> do not constitute the other a Good; but find and feel it to be such. The one is good, merely because it is grateful; the other is good and amiable in its own Nature, antecedently to all Events or Operations.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>As</strong> to <em>subordinate Ends</em>; and <em>particular Objects</em> of natural Affection, though these likewise are not determinable by <em>our Reason</em>, yet it does by no means follow, that there was originally no Reason or Ground for any Preference among them. It was in the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Power, as it became his infinite Wisdom, to determine and appoint for all his Creatures such <em>Ends</em>, <em>Objects</em>, and <em>Affections</em> as would be most conducive to the Order and Harmony, the Welfare and Perfection of the whole. These <em>Affections</em> are no otherwise dependent on our <em>Reason</em>, than as it may represent to us, that they ought to be regulated and restrained, when they grow exorbitant; and likewise suggest to us proper <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">proper [Means] | Means</span></span> Means for effecting it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If by <em>the Choice of Ends</em>, be meant any thing more than the Approbation of them; then it belongs not to our perceptive Faculties, but the <em>Will</em>, which very often rejects what those approve.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Tho</strong><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> <em>without supposing Sentiment</em>, no Reason can be given for the <em>Preference</em> of one of these Objects before another, or the Pursuit of any of them; yet in respect of <em>Moral Actions</em>, I apprehend the Case to be widely different. We prefer one Action before another, because we perceive it to be intrinsically better. <em>Moral Goodness</em> derives not its Worth from any <em>Sentiments</em>, or any Faculties; but is necessarily approved and admired by all Beings that are capable of understanding it. It does indeed promote many natural Ends in the highest and most effectual Manner; but this is not its only Excellence, nor even its chief Perfection. <em>Virtue</em> is it self, and in its own Nature, of all <em>Objects</em>, the noblest, over all Ends, supreme.

<strong>Ans</strong>. If <em>this Scheme be the only reasonable one</em>, or more reasonable than the other; it will and ought to prevail, whatever Objections may lie against it.

But the Resolution of the main Question seems, in some measure, to depend upon it. For if <em>Reason</em> be our chief Faculty, and <em>Virtue</em> the highest Perfection of which we are capable; it follows, with great Probability, that they belong to each other. Such a Conclusion is agreeable to the Order of Nature; as it is strongly enforced by other Considerations already insisted on.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Properly speaking, it is not our <em>Faculty</em> of Reason, but <em>Reason objectively</em> considered, that is the <em>Foundation of Morality</em>. Those <em>Reasons and Relations of Things</em>, which necessarily flow from the Natures and Circumstances of Agents and Objects.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. It seems to me, that <em>Reason</em> is as much superior to <em>Instinct</em>, as a <em>Man</em> is to a <em>Brute</em>. The <em>Instinctive</em> Operations of some Brutes are very wonderful, and perhaps exceed the finest Productions of human Art. Nevertheless <em>Reason</em> gives Men so many, and such manifest Advantages, that it is needless to insist on them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It is very true, that our <em>Reason</em> is the <em>Gift of God:</em> So are likewise our <em>external Senses</em>. But it does not follow from hence, that they are of equal Value and Dignity with our <em>Understandings</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However <em>variable</em> or defective our <em>Faculty</em> of Reason may be, the <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Relations of Things</em> can never change. <em>Moral Rectitude</em> therefore is perpetually, and invariably the same, whatever Mistakes we may happen to commit about it. Our fallible <em>Understandings</em> may err in the Pursuit of any Science; but <em>Truth</em> is not to be shaken, or any way affected by our Misapprehensions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It is granted, that human <em>Virtue</em>, considered merely <em>as</em> Moral, cannot rise higher than human <em>Reason:</em> Since we cannot <em>act</em> to greater Perfection than we are able to <em>think</em>. All that follows from <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">from [hence] | hence</span></span> hence is, that our <em>Actions</em> may be sometimes unavoidably erroneous, as well as our <em>Judgments</em>. And whether we have, or have nor, the <em>Sentiments</em> here supposed, Experience informs us, that we are often forced to commit both speculative and practical Mistakes.

<strong>Art</strong>. XXVIII. You say, <em>Reason alone can justify the Choice of a Moral Agents who is no further Praise-worthy, than as he acts in Conformity thereto</em>. You say likewise that <em>instinctive Goodness is the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Goodness</em>. What is more or less Praise-worthy in the Exercise of one Faculty above another, is very difficult to determine. I suppose that all our Faculties come equally from God. And whatever I act voluntarily, that is, by an Exertion of the Will; is, I think, as properly my own Action, as any Action can possibly be. For the rest, my Reason is altogether independent of my Choice; as my Sentiments, or any Sort of Instinct can be. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. It seems not possible to discover the true <em>Foundation of Virtue</em>, or the <em>Origi</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Origi</em>- [<em>nal</em>] | <em>nal</em></span></span><em>nal of our Ideas</em> concerning it; without enquiring what is, or is not, <em>Praise-worthy</em> in the <em>Exercise</em> of our <em>Faculties</em>, and in the Exercise of <em>one above another</em>. For whatever constitutes Moral Actions <em>Praise-worthy</em>, constitutes them <em>Virtuous</em>; and whatever enhances their <em>Merit</em>, enhances their <em>Virtue</em>. Moral <em>Virtue</em> is Moral <em>Worth</em>, which entirely consists in the <em>Conformity</em> of our Actions to <em>Reason</em>; that is, to the true <em>Reasons and Relations of Things</em>, where they can be discovered, and where they cannot to the <em>Understanding</em> of the Agent.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Our Approbation of <em>Virtue</em> is not an arbitrary Deference, a voluntary Respect paid to it, but is the necessary Effect: of its essential Worth. As we are compelled to <em>assent</em> to whatever appears <em>true</em>, so we are forced to <em>approve</em> whatever appears <em>right</em>. But this Necessity is not external. It flows directly from the intrinsick Excellence, and Self-amiableness of the Thing approved.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But in order to produce a virtuous, or meritorious Action, what we <em>necessarily approve</em>, that we must <em>freely chuse</em>. Without a <em>Conformity to Reason</em>, no Action can be <em>right</em>; without <em>an Exertion of the Will</em>, it could not really be an <em>Action</em>. And as <em>Action</em> and <em>Passiveness</em>, are inconsistent Ideas, so are <em>Passiveness</em> and <em>Merit</em>. For no Man can be said to act laudably, who acts not at all. If in any Case he be partly active, and partly passive, whatever be produced thereby, nothing is to be placed to his Account, but his own Share <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Share [of] | of</span></span> of the Action. As far as he is <em>passive</em>, so far himself can pretend to no Praise; whatever may be due to any co-operating Agent.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> will not pretend to determine precisely what Share of our <em>instinctive</em> Actions belongs to us, and what does not: But it seems to me exceeding plain, that our <em>Rational</em> Actions are much more <em>our own</em>, than our <em>instinctive</em> ones. For tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> there be an <em>Exertion of the Will</em> in the latter, yet so great a Weight, so strong a Bias is put upon it, that instead of being inclined, or induced, it may be said, to be almost driven.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;When a Man, finding himself unexpectedly at the Brink of a Precipice, suddenly starts back; this <em>instinctive Action</em> cannot certainly be thought as much; and as properly <em>his own</em>, as the deliberate avoiding of such a Place. Part of it, at least, is to be ascribed to the Strength of the Impulse. And I am not certain whether this be sufficient. It may possibly be not the Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Action at all, but the Effect of some other Cause. For tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> neither <em>Ideas</em>, nor <em>instinctive Principles</em> can act; as being not <em>Substances</em>, yet the Almighty Author of them, being an omnipresent Substance, can ever act, where, when, and how he pleases. It may therefore, deserve to be considered, whether some of those instinctive Actions which are commonly ascribed to his <em>Creatures</em>, may not more properly be ascribed to the <em>Creator</em>. Whether He produce them, or only co-operate in the Production of them; it seems very evident to <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">to [me,] | me,</span></span> me, that the Goodness of any Actions, considered as instinctive, is <em>the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Goodness</em>, and not the <em>Creature<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s</em>.

<strong>It</strong> is very true, that <em>all our Faculties come equally from God</em>. But this does not prove them to be equally valuable. Every thing produced by Him is good in its Kind.

And the same Observation may be made in respect of our <em>Senses</em>, <em>Instincts</em>, and <em>Understandings</em>.
</div>

<strong>Tho</strong><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it was not owing to our <em>Choice</em>, that we were formed either <em>reasonable</em>, or <em>sensible</em> Creatures, yet it depends upon our Choice, whether we will act reasonably or unreasonably, virtuously or viciously.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be alledged, that the <em>Reasons of Things</em>, or <em>Moral Fitness</em> may operate on our Minds as forcibly as <em>Instincts</em>; and, by Consequence, equally diminish our Liberty, and lessen the Merit of our Moral Actions: I answer, That the Cases are widely different. The <em>Reasons of Things</em> are indeed fit to influence the Will in a <em>Moral</em> way; otherwise they would not be eligible. But they do not at all impair, or affect our <em>Natural Liberty</em>. For as they have no real Efficiency, they cannot possibly produce any <em>Physical</em> Effect, or Alteration in the Mind.

Every <em>Natural</em> or implanted <em>Affection</em> is such a Pre-determination; which may indeed be resisted, or counteracted; but it is manifest, that the resisting of such a Principle requires a much stronger Effort of the Mind, than complying with it.

Error is certainly a Defect; but that Defect: is not always criminal. It is not Error, but wilful Error, that we condemn. Therefore it is not Reason, but some other Faculty that is upon Trial, when we judge of the Justifiableness of any Action.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. By the <em>Reasonableness</em> of an <em>Action</em>, may either be meant its Conformity to the true <em>Reasons and Relations of Things</em>; or to the <em>Understanding</em> of the Agent. The Compliance of the <em>Will</em> with a <em>mis-informed</em> Un<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Un- [derstanding] | derstanding,</span></span>derstanding, justifies the Agent, in respect of that Action. The Compliance of the Will with a <em>well-informed</em> Understanding, not only justifies the Agent, but is really in it self a <em>right</em> Action. An involuntary Error is certainly blameless. But tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it can never be reputed a <em>Crime</em>, it may be, and often is, an <em>Incapacity</em>. It may disable the Agent so far, as to obstruct the Rectitude and Perfection of his Actions. What is it then that acquits and justifies an erroneous Agent? The <em>Reasonableness</em> of his Actions. For tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they are not conformable to the true <em>Reasons of Things</em>, yet they are conformable to his own <em>Reason</em> and Judgment. And indeed by all the Reason in the World he is to be acquitted, and even commended, for following the best Light that he was able to get. As I know no other <em>Faculty</em>, besides that of <em>Reason</em>, that can possibly <em>judge</em> of such a Case; so I see not the least Occasion for introducing or supposing any other. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the <em>real</em> Relations of Things are the true Rule of a Moral Agent; yet when that Rule is out of his Reach, Reason allows and directs him to be governed by <em>apparent</em> ones.

<strong>Ans</strong>.

The <em>Rectitude</em> of Actions must not only be <em>perceived</em>, but <em>intended</em>. And this, I presume, may very well be done without <em>Sentiment</em>. If <em>moral Rectitude</em> be self-amiable, and self-eligible, it must be <em>approved</em>; and by Consequence, may be <em>intended</em> and pursued without any other View. And why may not a <em>Rational Approbation</em> recommend it to our Choice, with, or without a <em>Natural Propensity?</em> It is granted that a virtuous <em>Intention</em> is essential to <em>Virtue</em>. This is perfectly agreeable to the <em>Rational</em> Scheme; according to which, the chief <em>End</em> or <em>Aim</em> of the Agent is <em>Virtue</em> it self. But how is it consistent with the <em>instinctive</em> Scheme; according to which, the Agent only follows the Bias of his Nature, and the Tendencies and Pre-determinations of his own Mind.

For I look upon it that Sentiment alone can justify the Choice of a Moral Agent. Sentiment directs the Intention; Reason only recommends the Manner of Pursuit. If we do not act reasonably, our Actions are not justifiable in point of Reason: But in point of Morality, we are to be judged by Sentiment as well as Reason; and the Intention is the principal Consideration.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. I have already observed, that the true <em>Foundation</em> of <em>Virtue</em> is not our <em>Faculty</em> of Reason, but the intrinsick <em>Reasons and Relations of Things</em>. As to the Faculties here compared, the Object of the one is <em>relative</em> and <em>factitious</em> Good; the Object of the other is <em>real</em>, <em>essential</em>, and <em>absolute</em> Good. If <em>Instinct justify the Choice</em> of the former, well may <em>Reason</em> justify the Choice of the latter. That there is such a thing as a <em>Rational Intention</em>, and that it is more laudable than an <em>instinctive</em> one; I have endeavoured to shew elsewhere. That <em>Instincts</em> may be subservient <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">subservient [to] | to</span></span> to <em>Morality</em>, and useful to <em>Moral Agents</em>, is not denied: But that they are essential to Virtue, I can no way comprehend. Whatever Regard be had to the <em>Intention</em>, I only insist, that a <em>Rational</em> one is more worthy than an <em>affectionate</em> one.

<strong>Art</strong>. XXXII. Sentiment shews us what to pursue; Reason how to pursue it. Sentiment makes us what we are; Reason only shews us what we are. Or, if you please, Sentiment makes us honest, benign, submissive to Reason, (which Reason alone cannot do) Lovers of Honour, and Knowledge, and excites us to great Attempts. Reason can only make us more knowing, but without the other can never make us wise. In all these Considerations, I think Sentiment is both antecedent and preferable to Reason.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. <em>Reason</em> both <em>shews us what to pursue</em>, and <em>how to pursue it</em>. It not only <em>shews us what we are</em>, but, in a great measure, <em>makes us what we are</em>, and distinguishes us from inferior Creatures. <em>Reason</em> recommends to us <em>Honesty</em>, <em>Benignity</em>, <em>Submissiveness to Reason</em>, and every other Virtue. It applauds us <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">us [whenever] | whenever</span></span> whenever we act conformably thereto, and condemns every Violation of them. It is by this Faculty alone, that we discover the intrinsick Value, and Excellence of <em>Truth</em>; and that we are capable of the Knowledge of it. If it be owing to <em>Sentiment</em> that we are <em>Lovers of Honour</em>; it is only a <em>reasonable</em> Conduct that can make us <em>worthy</em> of it. If <em>Sentiment</em> spur us on to <em>great Attempts</em>, <em>Reason</em> directs and exhorts to the same; and the more <em>Reason</em> is concerned and consulted in them, the <em>greater</em> and better they are. <em>Reason</em> not only leads to <em>Knowledge</em>, but <em>Wisdom</em>; and upon all Occasions, the more we hearken to <em>Reason</em>, the <em>wiser</em> we are. <em>Sentiment</em> is indeed <em>antecedent to Reason</em>, and so is Infancy to Manhood. But Priority is one thing, and Preference another. In short, acting according to <em>Instinct</em>, may be looked upon as the Infant State of <em>Virtue</em>; but acting according to <em>Reason</em>, its Maturity and Perfection.

For what ever is meant by those Expressions, must be the Object of Sentiment, and not of Reason. Reason can only judge of relative Worth and Goodness, and Fitness <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Fitness [rela-] | relatively</span></span> relatively to some End. To shew why a Thing is absolutely fit, is to shew that it is not absolutely fit, but fit for some external Reason.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. If this Doctrine represent <em>Virtue</em> as a Good merely <em>relative</em>, and <em>factitious</em>; it does more than <em>derogate from its absolute</em> and essential <em>Goodness</em>. And according to my Apprehensions, this must be the Case, if <em>Virtue</em> be an <em>Object of Sentiment, and not of Reason</em>. The only Faculty by which we do or can perceive <em>the absolute Fitness and inherent Goodness of Virtue</em>, is, I presume, that which we call <em>Reason</em> or <em>Intelligence</em>. For it is by this Faculty only that we are capable of comparing Ideas, and finding out their essential Agreements and Disagreements. Properly speaking, no <em>Sense</em> is capable of perceiving any other Agreement than that of the Object with it self. I am not able to distinguish these Faculties any otherwise; and without this Distinction, the Words <em>Understanding</em> and <em>Sense</em> seem to me to have no determinate Meaning. <em>Sensible Good</em> is <em>made</em> such, and depends entirely on the Will of the Creator. <em>Intellectual Good</em> is <em>unmade</em>, as necessarily flowing from the Perfections of the Divine Nature. As to the <em>Relative Fitness</em>, here mentioned, <em>of Means to some End</em>; that indeed is no Object of <em>Sense</em>. <em>Reason</em> only can discover it, and judge of it. But is this the ut<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">ut- [most] | most</span></span>most Extent of <em>Reason</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Province? Does it not also take in <em>absolute Fitness?</em> If there be any <em>Self-worth</em> in <em>Virtue</em>, I have no Idea of any Faculty, but that of <em>Reason</em> or <em>Intelligence</em>, by which it can possibly be perceived.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Of <em>absolute Fitness</em>, no Reason can be assigned but <em>Necessity</em>.

<strong>Ans</strong>. If the true Idea of <em>Virtue</em> be that of <em>acting conformably to Instinct</em>; this Supposition, shocking as it is, seems unavoidable. But if this Supposition be improbable and absurd; from thence it will follow, that such an Idea of Virtue ought to be rejected. Now besides that this Supposition seems to derogate very much both from the Dignity of Virtue, and of human Nature; I might produce several Considerations to shew the Absurdity of it. But as this would engage me in a long and unnecessary Digression, I shall content my self with observing at present, that such an Opinion contradicts the general Apprehensions <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Apprehensions [of] | of</span></span> of Mankind. However Men have differed in their Ideas concerning <em>Brutes</em>, I think they have been unanimous in denying them any <em>Moral Capacities. Aliquid simile virtutis,</em> as <em>Cicero</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> expresses it, is the utmost Allowance that I have ever met with. I know no Author more liberal in his Concessions to Brutes, than Mr. <em>Locke</em>. Yet he never supposes them to be <em>Moral Agents</em>. The Author of the <em>Characteristicks</em> speaks of them as being <em>Good</em>; that is, regular, and <em>well-affectioned</em> according to their Kinds; but never calls them <em>virtuous</em>. Nay, he guards against such an Opinion; and expressly tells us,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that <em>Virtue or Merit is allow<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d to Man only</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only add, that a stronger Prejudice cannot well lie against any Scheme or Doctrine, than its being chargeable with such a Consequence, as that of Brutes being capable of Virtue; and indeed if <em>Virtue</em> were not some thing above their Capacities, I question whether any Man would think it worth his Time and Pains to dispute about it. I mean in a <em>Moral</em> Way. For that those Creatures afford very curious and wonderful Entertainment to the <em>Naturalist</em> is not to be denied.

You argue, that if Virtue consist in kind Affections, then the stronger those Affections are, the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [greater] | greater</span></span> greater the Virtue; which I think does not hold. I do not think Virtue consists in Affections, but in acting rationally; which cannot be done, in my Opinion, without going upon the Principle of Sentiment. If any of our Affections are carried to a more than natural Height so as to disappoint themselves, or interrupt the Satisfaction of other Affections, which are perhaps as strongly grafted in our Nature, and claim an equal Regard; they can certainly exceed the Bounds of Virtue. Otherwise I do not see why it may not be owned, that the stronger the Affection, the greater the Virtue.

<strong>Ans</strong>. How Virtue <em>can consist in acting rationally</em>, and yet be impracticable <em>without Sentiment</em>, seems very difficult to comprehend. A Principle of <em>Reason</em>, and a Principle of <em>Instinct</em>, appear to me as distinct, as any two Principles can be. Though Mankind have both, yet they might have had either without the other. We see many <em>irrational</em> Creatures abounding in <em>Affections</em> and <em>Instincts</em>. And probably there are many Creatures of an Order superior to Man, possessed of much higher Degrees of <em>Intelligence</em>, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Intelligence</em>, [with-] | without</span></span> without any<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Instincts</em> at all. And indeed if seems to me very manifest that the more perfect any Creature is, the less Occasion he has for these implanted Propensities and Pre-determinations.

<div class="indented numbered">
Our <em>Reason</em> was not given us to assist and support our <em>Instincts</em>; but these Instincts were planted in us as Auxiliaries to our Reason; to facilitate our reasonable Undertakings, and quicken us in the Execution of its Orders. It must indeed be confessed, that our Instincts, while they are kept within the Bounds and the Order of Nature, are of great Service to such frail Creatures as Men. They both point out the Road to Virtue, and urge us into it. It deserves likewise to be considered, how our <em>Moral</em> Instincts counterbalance the grosser ones of <em>Sense</em>, and our <em>publick</em> Affections our <em>private</em> ones. They are good Arguments therefore of the <em>Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s</em> Wisdom and Goodness; but in respect of us, they can be nothing more than Helps and Incentives to Virtue.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Instinct</em> and <em>Reason</em>, though united in our Minds, are separated in those of other Creatures, as I before observed. As to <em>Brutes</em>, I can make no doubt of their being <em>unintelligent</em>; and yet we find <em>Instincts</em> prevailing among them in great Variety, and full Force.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What is merely effected by Instinct, cannot, I think, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">think, [be] | be</span></span> be in any Degree meritorious. For supposing some Concurrence of the <em>Will</em>, yet if <em>Reason</em> be unconcerned, and out of the Case, what avails a blind, and almost extorted Volition? There can be no more Worth in such an Action, than in the Obedience of a Horse to the Spur.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>We</strong> may indeed pursue an <em>Instinct</em> in Conformity to <em>Reason</em>. We may infer from our, having such an Instinct, that it is the Will of the Creator we should observe its Motions. And if, upon this Account we comply with it, we act both <em>rationally</em> and <em>religiously</em>. <em>Religion</em> being ultimately founded on the most perfect Reason, can never possibly interfere with <em>Moral Virtue</em>, but must be always coincident with it. Nevertheless, their immediate Ground and Rule being different, they must be distinct Ideas; and should not therefore be confounded, as I before took notice.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to return; however Actions may be mixed, or compounded, as flowing from the united Principles of Reason and Instinct; I cannot but suppose, that the Worth of such Actions is in Proportion to the Share of Influence which Reason has in the Production of them. The Force of the <em>Natural Impulse</em>, whatever it amounted to, must, I think, be subtracted in the Estimate. Let us compare two Actions, in which the Predominance of each Principle may be supposed very great, in order to con<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">con- [ceive] | ceive</span></span>ceive more easily and clearly wherein Moral Merit consists.

Can any one be at a Loss to determine, which of these Actions is more meritorious? The former is very natural, and therefore appears very amiable. Compassion too pleads in Behalf of the Parent, as well as her Sex. And the immediate Hazard of Life weighs much in her Favour. But notwithstanding these Considerations, the <em>Virtue</em> and <em>Moral Merit</em> of the two Actions will bear no Comparison.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Or, set the Difference of these two Principles in a stronger Light; let us compare any Instance of <em>Natural Affection</em>, with the Return of <em>Regulus</em> to <em>Carthage</em>. An Action so Heroically virtuous; that, perhaps, upon that very Account, the Truth of it has been called in Question; or at least, disadvantageous Constructions put upon it. What <em>affectionate</em> Conduct ever raised such a Character, or made such a Figure in History, as this single Instance of <em>severe Virtue?</em>

<strong>But</strong> how does <em>acting rationally</em> presuppose, or infer, the Principle of <em>Sentiment?</em> Is nothing Good, nothing Eligible, but what Nature has recommended, and pointed out? Can we approve no Object without a natural Pre-engagement of our Minds? It is never pretended that our Assent to <em>Truth</em>, or Acquiescence in it, is owing to any <em>Instinct</em>. Why then must we have Recourse to such a Principle for the Approbation of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>, which is a Branch of <em>Truths?</em> The <em>Relations</em> and <em>Reasons</em> of Things cannot depend upon <em>Instincts</em>. These cannot therefore be necessary either to make us <em>judge truly</em>, or <em>act rationally</em>.

<strong>All</strong> Moralists are agreed that we ought to <em>follow Nature</em>; but the Question is, how we are to follow it. Doubtless we ought primarily and principally to regard our <em>Reason</em>; because it is our governing Principle, our supreme Guide. All the other Principles in our Nature are placed in Subordination and Subjection to this. As an <em>Army</em> is to move and act in Obedience to its <em>General</em>, and by his Direction; so ought all the Powers of our Minds to be subject to <em>Reason</em>. We may indeed be directed by our inferior Principles, if <em>Reason</em> either approves, or does not gainsay.

<strong>When</strong> <em>natural Affections</em> rise too high; I presume they are reducible by <em>Reason</em>. Reason will inform a too affectionate and indulgent Parent, of the ill Consequences of such an Excess; and he may thereby be prevailed upon to check, and sometimes counter-act the Violence of his Affection. And if a Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Affections</em>, when immoderate, may be restrained by <em>Reason</em>, why may not the same Principle be equally useful in a contrary Case? I mean, why may not <em>Reason</em> supply the Deficiencies of <em>Affection</em>, when it is too weak; as well as curb its Extravagancies, when it grows too strong? And if so, why might it not influence the Man, and direct his Actions, supposing he had no such Affections at all? For if he can act <em>rationally</em> in those Cases where <em>Instinct</em> is deficient, or ineffectual; I cannot imagine what should hinder him from acting rationally, supposing him quite void of such an Instinct. If this be admitted, it follows from hence, that Virtue consists not in acting conformably to <em>Instinct</em>, but <em>Reason</em>.

I am not of their Opinion, who look up on natural Good, or Pleasure, as the only End; and that the neat Amount of Pleasure is what only deserves the Name of Happiness. For I think there are several other Objects of our Desires, that claim an equal Title to that Name.

In Reference to the latter, every particular <em>Object of natural Good</em> is approved and pursued.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;No particular <em>Object</em> of <em>Sense</em> is approved or pursued with any other View, or upon any other Account, than that of <em>Pleasure</em>, or <em>Gratification</em>; immediately or ultimately. The Mind is indeed predetermined and pre-attached to such Objects, by what I call an <em>instinctive</em> Principle. But when<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">when- [ever] | ever</span></span>ever it proposes an End, that End is <em>Pleasure</em>, or the <em>Removal of Pain</em>, between which it is needless to distinguish. An Infant is determined to the <em>Breast</em>, and searches for it, before it is capable of knowing why. But as soon as it has tasted <em>Pleasure</em>, and is capable of proposing it as an End, it applies to the Object with that View. An <em>Object</em> therefore may be pursued either <em>instinctively</em> and <em>blindly</em>, or <em>consciously</em>, and with an Intention. And this Intention or End is not, strictly speaking, the Object, but the Pleasure resulting from it.

Whether any <em>subordinate</em> End intervene or not; I know of no <em>Object</em> that is pursued by <em>sensible</em> Agents <em>for its</em> own Sake, <em>Pleasure</em> is always intended, either <em>immediately</em>, or <em>ultimately</em>; except in those Cases where the Agent acts irrationally, and at Random. And in those Cases there can be no End at all.

But all their Value consists in their being subservient and subordinate to the ultimate End above-mentioned.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>The Good of others</em>, or the Publick Good is but a <em>subordinate End</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> a very noble one. It may be pursued for the sake of <em>Pleasure</em>, and ought to be pursued for the sake of <em>Virtue</em>. But if it neither <em>gratified</em> the Mind of the Agent, nor appeared conformable to <em>Reason</em> and <em>Religion</em>, no Man living would stir a Finger in Behalf of his Fellow-creatures.

But in Truth, such <em>Affections</em> would either have no Force, or would soon lose it, if the Exercise of them was not accompanied with Pleasure to the Agent.

To be so far possessed with any of them, as to disable the Mind from taking proper Measures to obtain them; or to engross it so, as that the rest may not have a due Share of our Attention, is certainly a Vice, or Corruption of Nature.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. To want any Good, or any Degree of any Good that we are capable of, must certainly be a <em>Defect</em>. But in our present Conditions and Circumstances it is, more or less, unavoidable. To pursue <em>Moral Good</em> in such a manner as to overlook <em>Natural Good</em>, is confessedly wrong. But it is more wrong to pursue <em>Natural Good</em>, exclusively of <em>Moral Good</em>. The Value of every particular <em>Object</em>, and every <em>subordinate End</em>, is to be estimated by their greater or <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">or [lesser] | lesser</span></span> lesser Tendencies to promote the <em>ultimate Ends</em> above-mentioned. And as Virtue is in its own Nature superior to <em>Pleasure</em>, our Pursuits of the latter ought always to be consistent with the former, and regulated by it. Especially since every Inconvenience hereby occasioned, will be abundantly compensated by the great Governor of the World; as was observed in my former Papers.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;A <em>Rational</em> Pursuit of the <em>Good of Others</em> is the very Practice of <em>Virtue</em>. And as far as <em>Fame</em> and <em>Power</em> contribute to this End, so far the Pursuit of them is even laudable. But in respect of Pleasure, and Self-gratification, if we are very anxious and solicitous about those Objects, our Losses will exceed our Gains, and instead of promoting, we snail obstruct the End in view.

<strong>Art</strong>. XL. Thus we may perhaps have found a just Mean between the <em>Stoick</em> and the <em>Epicurean</em> Philosophers; making neither Virtue alone, which would be a self-evident Contradiction to Nature; nor Pleasure alone, which would highly reflect upon the Dignity of it, the Seat of Happiness, and End of our Desires. But placing the greatest Good in the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [just] | just</span></span> just and proportionable Satisfaction of every one of these Sentiments, which seem in some Degree or other, inherent to the Nature of every thinking Being.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Ans</strong>. It seems to me, that neither the <em>Stoicks</em> nor <em>Epicureans</em> considered Men as Men, but, as it were, divided Human Nature between them. The <em>Epicureans</em>, forgetting themselves to be <em>Moral Agents</em>, and overlooking <em>Moral Good</em>, regarded only <em>Sensibility</em>. Or if they admitted <em>Virtue</em>, it was with no other View than that of ministring to <em>Pleasure</em>. On the other hand, the <em>Stoicks</em> forgeting [!!!] themselves to be <em>Sensible</em> Beings, and overlooking <em>Natural Good</em>, regarded only <em>Morality</em>. Or if they admitted <em>Pleasure</em>, it was only that which is produced by <em>Virtue</em>. They plainly saw that <em>Virtue</em> is good <em>in itself</em>, <em>absolutely</em> and <em>essentially</em> good, and thence concluded that it must be the true End of <em>Moral Agents</em>. So far their Conclusion was just. But it does by no means follow from hence, that it is <em>Man</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s only End; who, as he is a <em>Sensible</em> Agent, must have other Ends and other Objects to pursue. And as the rejecting of <em>Moral Good</em> is highly unreasonable, and therefore unnatural, so the rejecting of <em>Sensible Good</em> is very unnatural, and therefore unreasonable.

<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">unreasonable. [<strong>Whatever</strong>] | <strong>Whatever</strong></span></span>
<strong>Whatever</strong> <em>Happiness</em> or <em>Satisfaction</em>, <em>Virtue</em> may produce, this is not that inherent Worth, that Self-excellence which constitutes it the End of <em>Moral Agents</em>, who are primarily to regard and pursue it, not as <em>satisfactory</em>, not as <em>beatifick</em>; but as <em>right</em>, and <em>fit</em>, and <em>worthy</em> in it self, independently of all Consequences and Effects. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> <em>Virtue</em> cannot make Men <em>happy</em> in the midst of Misfortunes, Miseries, and Torments, it can make them virtuous. And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> <em>suffering Virtue</em> be an Irregularity, yet that Irregularity, which is permitted at present for wise Ends, will in due Time be fully rectified. As <em>Moral Agents</em>, <em>Virtue</em> is our End and our <em>Rule</em>. And it is always worthy to be so, whatever Circumstances we may happen to fall into. If at any time it prove repugnant to our <em>Happiness</em>, nothing follows from hence, but the Certainty of a Future State.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> do not see how it <em>reflects on the Dignity of our Nature</em>, to make <em>Happiness</em> consist in <em>Pleasure</em>. For I suppose <em>Pleasure</em> to signify every <em>Gratification</em> of the Mind; and how any Thing can add to our <em>Happiness</em>, without some way or other <em>gratifying</em> our Minds, seems very hard to be conceived. If such a thing be possible, I must acknowledge my self not to have the least Idea of it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever Increase of <em>Satisfaction</em> may be supposed to result from any Combination of Objects, or <em>Proportion</em> of Enjoyments, it may <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">may [be] | be</span></span> be considered as a distinct Article; but still it is contained in the <em>Sum</em> of our <em>Pleasures</em>.

</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
BOTH Reason and Religion require, that whenever we think of the Deity, and contemplate his Perfections, we would raise our Ideas, and exalt our Conceptions as far as we are able. There is, in this Case, so vast a Disproportion between the Object and the Faculty, that when we exert our Minds to the utmost, and <em>put forth all our</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>our</em> [<em>Strength,</em>] | <em>Strength,</em></span></span> <em>Strength</em>, as the Son of <em>Sirach</em> expresses it, <em>we can never go far enough</em>; but are forced to fall infinitely short. Whatever therefore is really amiable or excellent, whatever is truly great or good, must carefully and constantly be ascribed to the Supreme Being.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Nevertheless</strong> it may deserve to be consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d, whether, in the Pursuit of this Rule, we be not sometimes led astray, through the Narrowness of our Minds, and the Weakness of our Conceptions. For tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we cannot possibly err in ascribing any real Perfection to Him, who, we are sure, is possessed of all that are possible; yet the Question is, whether our Ideas and Measures of Perfection may not sometimes fail us, and thereby prove the Occasions of our diminishing what we are endeavouring to magnify? More particularly I would observe, in respect of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Moral Perfections</em>, how prone we seem to distinguish and multiply them beyond measure, and, as I apprehend, without sufficient Grounds, Unmindful of that <em>Simplicity</em> of the Divine Nature, which is itself an undoubted Perfection; we frame to ourselves, instead of an uniform Principle of Action, a great Variety of distinct Attributes. The Consequence of which is, not only a Diminution of the great Idea, but an Introduction of divers Difficulties and Perplexities of Conception which would otherwise be avoided.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>However</strong> we may divide and distinguish God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s, Moral Attributes, according to the dif<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">dif- [ferent] | ferent</span></span>ferent Effects, Dealings and Dispensations resulting from them; yet in themselves they seem to be but one and the same Perfection variously exercised on different Objects and Occasions, and in different Cases and Circumstances; and cannot therefore, without Error and Inconvenience, be consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d as distinct Attributes. The Perfection I am speaking of, is that of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s determining himself by <em>Moral Fitness</em>, or acting perpetually according to the <em>Truth</em>, <em>Nature</em>, and <em>Reasons of Things</em>. His Justice, Righteousness, Truth, Faithfulness, Holiness, Goodness, Mercy, Long-suffering, and whatever other moral Characters may be ascribed to him, do all center in this Idea, and may properly be reduced to this single Principle. They are all comprehended in that <em>Moral Rectitude</em> or Righteousness, by which all the Divine Actions are unalterably conducted. Whether God visit Men in Mercy or Judgment, with Blessings or Calamities; whether he execute Sentence speedily, or suspend it for a long Time; the same sacred Rule is equally, and constantly, and inviolably observ<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d by him.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It is true indeed, that the Holy Scripture represents to us the moral Perfections of the Deity under all these several Characters, Distinctions, and Denominations. But I presume it is only by way of Accommodation to human Language, and human Conception. It ascribes to Him our Affections, our Passions, our Senses, and even Parts of our Bodies; but yet we do not suppose, that any <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">any [of] | of</span></span> of these Things are strictly applicable to the Deity; or any otherwise than in a figurative and foreign Sense. In like manner, human Virtues, which are so much diversify<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d by the Affections of our Nature, and the Peculiarities of our State and Condition, seem applied to the Deity, if not in a figurative, yet in a less proper Sense. I will not presume to affirm, that it is even an Impropriety to ascribe the several fore-mention<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d Characters to the Deity; much less that they are to be consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d in Him merely as <em>analogical</em>: but I humbly apprehend, that to view Him in so various and mixed a Light, is apt to dazzle the Eye, and mislead the Mind. Whenever we contemplate his Moral Character, we should possibly more consult His Honour, as well as our own Safety and Satisfaction, if we consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d Him as universally influenced and determined by the uniform Principle before-mentioned: If we conceived of Him in all his Proceedings and Dispensations, as ever doing what is <em>fit</em>; as ever regarding <em>the Right of the Case</em>, and the <em>true Reasons of Things</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>By</strong> confining our Ideas of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Moral Perfections to this Principle of <em>Rectitude</em>, we shall escape many Perplexities, if not many Errors. What more common, than for Men to bewilder themselves in searching for the Boundaries between Divine <em>Justice</em> and <em>Goodness?</em> By the one is generally understood a Communication of Blessings; by the other, an Infliction of Judgments and Calamities. As if <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">if [God] | God</span></span> God were not equally righteous in both Dispensations! If doing that which is right, and reasonable, and fit toward his Creatures, be Moral Goodness in the Deity, as surely it must; then his Goodness is as conspicuous in one Case as in the other.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>While</strong> the Melancholy and the Superstitious shrink and tremble at the Apprehensions of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Justice</em>, how apt is the sanguine and impenitent Sinner to flatter himself with I know not what Hopes from his infinite <em>Mercy?</em> Whereas if the true Rule and Principle of the Divine Conduct was duly considered by them, the one would find no Cause for his Presumption, nor the other for their Fears.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> we attend to this Principle, as far as we are capable of discovering the true Reasons and Relations of Things, so far we shall clearly know how to judge of the Divine Proceedings; We shall so far learn, what we are to conceive of Him, and what to expect from Him. For since God never acts arbitrarily, but always in Conformity to this sacred Rule, it must needs be our wisest and securest Course to turn our Thoughts this way, and inform ourselves concerning it as far as we are able. In many Cases, indeed, we shall be at a loss; as being utterly unable to discover those Reasons by which the Deity is determined. Whenever we find them thus unsearchable, we must be content to remain in Ignorance, in whatever Light we consider Things. It is great Folly <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Folly [and] | and</span></span> and Presumption to pretend to be wise above our Faculties, and beyond what has been revealed to us. But if some Things are obscure and impenetrable, it by no means follows from thence, that we are to shut our Eyes upon what is clear and evident. Nor ought we, where absolute Certainty is not to be had, to neglect Probabilities. We are, doubtless, to proceed with great Caution, Diffidence, and Modesty, whenever the Deity is the Subject of our Enquiries. But under this Guard, neither Reason nor Revelation discourages our Contemplations. It is the Duty and the Glory of all intelligent Creatures, to search into the Nature and Perfections of the great Creator; and the further Progress they make, the juster Cause they find for Love, Wonder, and Adoration.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>The</strong> natural and essential <em>Differences</em> of Things, necessarily constitute innumerable different <em>Relations</em>; from whence immediately flow those <em>Reasons</em> and Rules of Action which are the Basis of all <em>Morality</em>. To us, as well as all other rational Beings, the Natures and Reasons of Things are the Foundation of all right and virtuous Action; and therefore must, in ordinary Cases, be plain, and obvious, and familiar to our Understandings. As far as we are capable of Moral Virtue, so far the Reasons of Things must be discoverable by us. And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> there are infinite Relations, and infinite Reasons well known to the Deity, and altogether unknown to us; yet this need not, nor ought to hinder us from endeavouring, to <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">to [separate] | separate</span></span> separate what is plain from what is obscure, and what is probable from what is imperceptible.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Although</strong> our Knowledge of the Reasons of Things be thus shore and imperfect; yet I am persuaded it is sufficient to lead us to a clear and distinct, though not an adequate Idea of the <em>Divine Rectitude</em>. And moreover, that this Principle of <em>Rectitude</em> consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d simply, and in itself, will give more Light to the Divine Dispensations, and the Doctrines of Religion, than when it is resolved and divided into various Attributes; which, by seeming to interfere with each other, are apt to entangle Mens Thoughts, and perplex their Reasonings. My present Purpose being to try this briefly in a few Instances, I shall, without further Preface or Apology, begin with 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>CREATION</em>. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
IT is not to be doubted but the <em>Intention</em> of the Deity, in creating the World, was the <em>Production of Happiness</em>, or the Communication of Good. I will not presume to say His sole Intention; but a principal one, without question. It seems equally manifest, that the <em>Reason</em>, <em>Motive</em>, or <em>Principle</em> by which he was determined to execute this great Design, was the <em>Rectitude</em> of the Thing itself. To communicate Good, is an Action in its own Nature <em>right</em>, <em>fit</em>, <em>amiable</em>, and <em>worthy</em>. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>worthy</em>. [And] | And</span></span> And this intrinsick Fitness cannot fail to influence the Supreme Being, whose Moral Perfection consists in directing his Actions by the true Reasons of Things. I cannot avoid thinking, that the Divine Goodness is very much misapprehended, when it is consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d as a Physical <em>Propension</em>, or <em>Disposition</em> of Nature analogous to those Affections and Propensities which He has given us. Such a <em>Disposition</em>, as I apprehend, would be so far from constituting Moral Goodness, that it would derogate from it in Proportion to its Influence. To suppose in the Deity a benevolent Disposition <em>necessary</em> in itself, and in its Operations, is to suppose what is utterly inconsistent both with the Perfections of the Creator, and the Obligations of his Creatures. And supposing it did not necessarily produce beneficent Actions, but to be consistent with Freedom and Choice; yet still, according to the Extent of its Influence, it would depretiate good Actions, and detract from the Merit of the Agent.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>This</strong> will evidently appear, by considering and comparing Human Affections and Human Virtues. When a Man is born with an affectionate Disposition, and high Degrees of Benevolence; this, in itself, is not <em>Moral</em>, but <em>Natural</em> Goodness, or <em>Goodness of Nature</em>, as we justly call it. If we suppose another Person with lower Affections, and the same Abilities, equally beneficent; we plainly perceive the Moral Merit of the former to be less, in Proportion to the Betterness of his Natural <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Natural [Dispo-] | Disposition.</span></span>Disposition. And should we suppose a Third without any Natural Affection at all, producing, from a Principle of Reason and Duty, an equal Quantity of Beneficence, it is manifest that his Moral Worth would exceed that of the two former in Proportion to the Excellence of his Principle.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Unless</strong> therefore the Moral Goodness of the Creator differ in Kind, as well as in Degree, from that of his Creatures; I humbly suppose it follows, that if his Beneficence be merely and entirely owing to a Principle of Rectitude and Right Reason, it argues much greater Perfection than if it proceeded, either in whole or in part, from the Propension or Disposition above mentioned. And if this be true, the Supposition of such a Natural Propension must be injurious to his Honour; as lessening his Moral Excellence, and thereby derogating from his highest Perfection. To do Good, solely from a Love of <em>Moral Rectitude</em>, without any Natural Impulse or Incitement, seems to me the most perfect Goodness that we are capable of framing any Idea of; and as such, ought, I think, to be constantly ascribed to the Supreme Being.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>That</strong> the Production of Good, is perfectly agreeable to <em>Moral Rectitude</em>, or, that it is intrinsically <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em> to communicate Happiness, I have taken for granted; as being too plain a Truth to require or admit of a formal Proof. Where there is no Reason against such a Communication, there is always a Reason <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Reason [for] | for</span></span> for it, arising from the Nature of the Thing itself. Happiness, or Natural Good, would be no Good at all, if it were not preferable to Insensibility. Whenever therefore there is no Reason to the contrary, the Production of it must be better, fitter, and more reasonable, than the Non-production of it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> the next Inquiry is, Whether this be the only right Intention, the only reasonable View that the Deity could have, in the Creation of the World. Is this the only End becoming the Rectitude of his Nature, and worthy of Infinite Wisdom? This, I think, is commonly presumed; but on what Grounds, I am not able to discover. I see no Absurdity in supposing, that the Creator might have various Ends and Designs of which we have not the least Conception. But not to insist upon this, it may deserve to be consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d, Whether, within the Compass of our own Ideas, we may not find some other Intention befitting the Wisdom and Rectitude of the Supreme Being: We seem to have Grounds for such a Supposition, both from Reason and Revelation.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>We</strong> find the Scripture referring every thing to the <em>Glory of God</em>. We are there expressly told, That Men, and, by Consequence, other Beings, were <em>created by him for his Glory:</em> That <em>He made all Things for Himself</em>; <em>and for his Pleasure they are and were created</em>. These, and the like Expressions, are sometimes strained up to very improper Heights; and at other times explained quite away. I am far <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">far [from] | from</span></span> from thinking, that either in the Creation or Government of the World, God proposed to Himself the poor Praises and Applauses of his Creatures. Sooner might an Angel propose to himself the Homage of a Worm. Such an End as this was infinitely beneath the Divine Majesty. And when we are required to <em>glorify</em> Him, it cannot be upon his Account: but partly, because it is absolutely <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em> in itself, and therefore <em>morally good</em>; and partly, because it is essential to our <em>Happiness</em>, or <em>Natural Good</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Nevertheless</strong>, I can see no Reason why the Deity might not propose, and strictly intend that <em>Glory</em>, which consists in <em>His own Approbation</em> of his Works and Actions. It must certainly be always right, always fit, for a Being of infinite Perfection to act in such a Manner as may be most worthy of Himself, and most agreeable to Himself. As He possesses all Perfection, and necessarily approves it, He cannot but regard, in Proportion, every Kind, and every Degree of it, in the Works of his Hands. It is not therefore to be imagined, that He would omit any thing, in the Frame and Constitution of the Universe, that might really add or contribute to its Perfection. On the contrary, He would contrive and form it in such a Manner, that it might be every way, and in all respects, as lovely as possible in his own Eyes. When it is said, that <em>God saw every thing that he had made, and behold, it was very good</em>; what are we to <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">to [under-] | understand</span></span> understand by this Goodness? Is nothing more meant by it, than the Tendency and Conduciveness of every Thing to the Benefit of Living Creatures? Was not the Whole <em>made beautiful</em>, as well as beneficial? And did not Order and Regularity, Harmony and Proportion, appear quite through the System?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> is true, these Perfections of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Works are Additions to the Happiness of Intelligent Creatures, and may be considered as subservient to that purpose. But, surely, they were produced with a further View. If they have any real and intrinsick Worth, they must appear amiable in the Sight of the Creator Himself. And though, before the Creation, He had a clear and full Prospect of all that <em>Order</em> and <em>Beauty</em> which were afterwards diffused through the whole Universe; yet, I humbly conceive that, in creating the World, He was under a Moral Necessity of suiting it to his own perfect Ideas, and the exact Model in his own Mind. He is <em>of purer Eyes than to behold</em> Disorder and Irregularity, whether Moral, or Natural. And the more we examine His Works, the more Reason we shall find to conclude, that he would suffer nothing to come out of his Hands, which was not agreeable to Order, and perfect in its Kind. Not only every Individual is <em>fearfully and wonderfully made</em>, but a vast Variety of Species are fixed in a regular and beautiful Subordination; ascending from inanimate and stupid Matter, to Human Kind, and reaching beyond it higher <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">higher [and] | and</span></span> and further than our Faculties are able to follow them. Nay, it may reasonably be conjectured, that there are more Orders and Ranks of Beings above us, than beneath us; all contributing to make up that Scale, that System of Creatures, which no Wisdom less than infinite could contrive, no Power less than infinite accomplish.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> may safely be presumed, that the Deity necessarily loves <em>Order</em>, and abhors Confusion. Were it possible to suppose that Deformity and Disorder could be more conducive to the Happiness of His Creatures, than the contrary; even upon this Supposition it seems not probable that they would have been submitted to. It is not, perhaps, consistent with the Rectitude of the Divine Nature to suffer his Workmanship to be thus polluted, even for the Promotion of so good an End.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Where and how far these Ends do in Fact interfere, is above the Power of Man to determine. I doubt not but God has been graciously pleased to reconcile, and make them coincident as far as was possible. But it does not appear to me, that the <em>Order</em>, <em>Beauty</em>, and <em>Harmony</em> of the Universe are merely intended in Subordination and Subservience to the Welfare of Creatures. On the contrary, I know not whether the latter be not subordinate to the former, and limited by it. That as much <em>Happiness</em> was produced, and provided for, as was consistent with the <em>Order</em> and Perfection of the Universe, may perhaps be more properly sup<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">sup- [posed,] | posed,</span></span>posed, than <em>vice versa</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Had the Production of Happiness been the sole End which the Creator had in view, it is not, I think, to be doubted, but the utmost Possibilities of it would have been produced, at all Times, and in all Places. But as far as we are capable of judging from the <em>Ph&aelig;nomena</em> within our Reach, this seems not to be the Case. That Scale and Subordination of Beings before-mentioned, may seem to promote the <em>Order</em> and Harmony of the World, more than the <em>Happiness</em> of its Inhabitants. Had their several Powers and Perfections been more nearly equal, what would have been the Result? It seems probable that the latter of these Ends would have been advanced; and the former obstructed, if not destroyed. Whether such a boundless Communication of <em>Natural Good</em>, be not also inconsistent, in some Cases, with <em>Moral Order</em> and <em>Rectitude</em>, will be more properly inquired afterwards.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Upon</strong> the whole, if Order, Beauty, Harmony, be real Perfections, they must, of necessity, be not only amiable in the Sight of the Deity, but essential to His Nature. He cannot therefore produce Disorder of any Kind, or be the <em>Author of Confusion</em>. But do we not find many Disorders and Irregularities in the World, of various Kinds? What Account is to be given of them, consistently with this Principle? Doubtless the Creator is not chargeable with any of them. They are all to be attributed to his Creatures; who, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">who, [by] | by</span></span> by abusing their Liberty, have not only defiled and deformed the Moral World, but, in some measure, the Natural. Some Parts indeed of the latter may, through the Imperfection of our Faculties, seem to us irregular, which in reality are not so. But whatever is really irregular, and out of Order; we ourselves are, in all Probability, answerable for it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Notwithstanding</strong> what has been said concerning this Principle, I am sensible that the Reality of it is question<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d by some, and denied by others. <em>Order</em> and <em>Beauty</em> have been represented not as <em>real</em> and <em>absolute</em> in themselves, but merely <em>relative</em> to our Faculties, and as resulting entirely from the Constitution and Accommodation of a certain <em>internal Sense</em>. If this be a just Account, the foregoing Observations are altogether groundless. I am therefore obliged to consider this Matter a little further.

<strong>But</strong> first I would ask, if Order and Beauty be not real, but relative; if they consist wholly in an arbitrary Agreement between the Objects and the Sense; what means that wonderful <em>Apparatus</em>, that boundless Profusion of Art and Skill, which we every where meet with among the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Works? What means that curious<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Contexture, and elaborate Arrangement of Parts? Why are they so nicely adjusted to each other, and all made <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">made [sub-] | subservient</span></span> subservient to the Grandeur and Magnificence of the Whole? According to the present Supposition, how shall we avoid looking upon all this as mere Waste of Workmanship? If there be no objective Perfections, no real Improvements hereby introduced, I am forced to conclude, that a <em>Chaos</em> would have answered the Purpose full as well. For had our supposed <em>Sense of Beauty</em> been adapted and fitted accordingly, we might have had as agreeable Sensations from the rudest Objects, as the most finished ones. If an Agreement between Object and Sense be sufficient to produce a Perception of Beauty, it might be fully effected by an Accommodation of the Sense to any Object. What occasion therefore could there be to accommodate them to each other reciprocally? Much less could it be needful to prepare and compleat all Objects in so stupendous a manner.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>The</strong> more I consider this Matter, the more I am convinced, that the <em>Grounds</em> of <em>Beauty</em> lie deeper than is here supposed. That they are not to be sought for among our <em>Senses</em>, or the <em>Agreements</em> between those <em>Senses</em>, and their respective <em>Objects</em>; but in the <em>Objects</em> themselves, and the <em>Relations</em> interceding between them. And by consequence that <em>Beauty</em> is of an <em>absolute</em> Nature, and a real, <em>objective Perfection</em>. The ingenious Author of the <em>Enquiry into the Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he professedly maintains the contrary Opinion, yet has nevertheless fixed <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">fixed [Beauty] | Beauty</span></span> Beauty on such a Foundation, as seems to me entirely inconsistent with his own Notion. For are not <em>Uniformity</em> and <em>Variety</em> real <em>Relations</em> belonging to the <em>Objects</em> themselves? Are they not independent on us, and our Faculties; and would they not be what they are, whether we perceived them or no?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And if they have no Dependance on any of our Faculties, much less on <em>Sense:</em> However Sense may convey to us the Ideas of external <em>Objects</em>, yet the <em>Relations</em> between them no <em>Sense</em> can reach. These are perceived by <em>Intelligence</em> only. The Understanding is the sole Faculty by which we are capable of comparing one Idea with another, and discovering their real Agreements and Disagreements. And hence, I presume, it is, that we acquire the intellectual Ideas of Equality, Variety, Resemblance, Uniformity, Order and Proportion. That in consequence of such Perceptions, our Minds are affected with pleasing <em>Sensations</em>, does by no means prove that such Perceptions themselves are <em>sensible</em>. Many other Perceptions merely intellectual excite Pleasure; but this <em>Pleasure</em> should not be confounded with those <em>Perceptions:</em> And whether it may be considered as the Object of some correspondent Sense, I shall not now enquire.

<em>ALL Beauty is Truth</em>,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> says the penetrating Author of the <em>Characteristicks</em>. But what are we to suppose is here meant by <em>Truth?</em> Only the Agreement of the Object with its proper Sense? If this be all, I see not with what Propriety it can be called <em>Truth</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be alledged, that <em>Beauty</em> is here said to be <em>Truth</em>, as the Preception [sic] of it requires a <em>true Taste</em>; then the Question will be, what is a <em>true Taste?</em> To call that a <em>true Taste</em> which really suits, and corresponds to its Object, is to say nothing: for in this Sense all <em>Tastes</em> are true. If it be said, that the truest Taste is that which produces the truest <em>Plea</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Plea</em>- [<em>sure</em>;] | <em>sure</em>;</span></span><em>sure</em>; how is the truest <em>Pleasure</em> to be discovered or determined? If by <em>Sense</em>, we are just where we set out; since nothing is to be found this way, but the Agreement between Object and Faculty. And indeed, while <em>Beauty</em> is considered as a <em>sensible Object</em>, I see no Possibility of advancing any further.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Accordingly this Author appears sometimes to have had a further Meaning. In several Places he seems to consider Beauty as an absolute, objective Perfection, resulting from certain fixed Relations essentially interceding between our Ideas. <em>True Features</em>, says he,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>make the Beauty of a Face</em>; <em>and true Proportions the Beauty of Architecture</em>. Agreeably whereto it may be supposed he would allow, that true Actions and true Affections make <em>Moral Beauty</em>. It must indeed be confessed, that<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> elsewhere he speaks in a different Strain; insomuch that it is no easy Matter to discover what was, upon the whole, his Opinion concerning this Matter.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Whatever</strong> Diversity there may be in Mens Tastes, Fancies, or Perceptions; I presume the Essentials of Beauty are unconcerned therein. Without Order, Symmetry, and Proportion, no Works of Art are, or can be, beautiful; and according to the Degree wherein those prevail, the Beauty of these is greater or less. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> in <em>Architecture</em> there are various Orders and Manners, yet <em>Uniformity</em> and <em>Pro</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Pro</em>- [<em>portion</em>] | <em>portion</em></span></span><em>portion</em> are observed in all: even in <em>Gothick</em> Buildings; however they may be encumbered with inelegant Devices, and ill-chosen Decorations. However Men may differ about the Circumstantials of Beauty, they are generally agreed as to the Essentials. And the Reason of it is, if I mistake not, because they are of a fixed, unalterable Nature; that is, absolute, intrinsick, and necessary <em>Relations</em>; and by consequence Objects of the <em>Understanding</em> only. For tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Discernment of Beauty is clearer and quicker in some Men than others; this is no more than what may be said in respect of other kinds of Truth. Experience shews, that the same Understandings which are very apt and quick in learning some Arts and Sciences; yet are taught others very heavily, and difficultly, and perhaps not at all. What therefore the Author last mentioned calls a <em>true Taste</em>, seems to be in reality nothing more than an <em>Understanding</em> fitted by Nature, and formed by Instruction, to perceive and distinguish the various Kinds of <em>Beauty</em>. Nor can I see any Reason, why a Genius for <em>Mathematicks</em> may not as well be ascribed to a distinct Faculty; as a Genius for <em>Painting</em>, <em>Statuary</em>, or <em>Architecture</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return from this Digression, if it be one, to the Order and Beauty of the Creation: Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we cannot presume to judge how the Universe appears in the Eyes of the Deity; yet, excepting those Blemishes which have been occasioned by the Misbehaviour of his <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">his [Creatures,] | Creatures,</span></span> Creatures, it is not, I think, to be doubted, but it is most regular, most harmonious, and most beautiful in his Sight. And such must the Plan of it have appeared, before the Creation, in his All-comprehensive Mind. These Beauties therefore must be real, absolute, and objective Perfections. For whatever the Creator sees in his Works, or Ideas, must actually be in them. What they appear to Him, that they precisely are in themselves. It is inconsistent with the Perfection of the Deity, to ascribe any of his Perceptions to an accommodated Faculty, or to any thing analogous thereto. Either therefore the Natural and Moral World appear without Beauty to the Divine Mind, or the Beauties which he perceives in them must be real and inherent. And if they consist in fixed, unchangeable Relations, they can have no more Dependance on any Precipient [???], than other Kinds of necessary Truth. These would be real Truths, and those real Beauties, whether any Being perceived them, or no: But, in Fact, the Perception of them is as necessary as the Things themselves.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> then <em>Beauty</em> be real <em>Truth</em>, or founded on Truth, it must unavoidably claim the Regard of all intelligent Beings: And the more intelligent they are, the more amiable it must appear to them. No wonder then the all-perfect Creator should be influenced by it, and ever act with a special View to it: That He should frame the World in Conformity to its Rules, and <em>pour it over all his Works</em>. The Order of <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">of [the] | the</span></span> the Universe. may be looked upon as sacred; and a regular Subordination of Creatures as a necessary Perfection. And though we cannot determine how far this Principle may be brought, by Divine Wisdom, to coincide with the former, <em>viz</em>. the Communication of Happiness; yet, I think, there are Grounds to conclude, that neither is entirely subordinate to the other. Perhaps neither is carried to its utmost Extent; but some Times, and in some Cases, the one seems to prevail, and sometimes the other. However, we find large and liberal Provision made in both respects; which Would still be found much larger, if we did not lessen it by our own Folly and Perverseness.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Whoever</strong> supposes that the Order, Beauty, and Harmony of the Universe are intended merely as subservient to the Enjoyments of Living Creatures, will find it difficult to reconcile such a Supposition with the Appearances which he meets with. For, to mention nothing else, how inconsiderable are the Enjoyments of lower Ranks of Creatures, in Comparison of the higher? Had all been created <em>intelligent</em>, all endued with the Powers and Faculties of <em>Angels</em>; what may we suppose would have been the Consequence? In all Probability, an Increase of <em>Happiness</em>, and a Destruction of <em>Order</em>. Since then this is not the Case; may we not reasonably conclude, that the latter could not be so far violated for the sake of the former? I think, it appears, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">appears, [from] | from</span></span> from what has been said, that both these Intentions are worthy of the Deity; both agreeable to the Rectitude and Perfection of his Nature; but if we suppose either of them, separate from, the other, to have been his sole End and Motive; we shall, I fear, find ourselves involved in inextricable Difficulties.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> we consider the <em>Goodness</em> of God as an unbounded <em>Benevolence</em>, prompting Him to produce all possible Happiness; we shall, perhaps, both expose ourselves to needless Difficulties, and entertain wrong Conceptions of Him. But if we consider Him as perpetually acting according to the true Reasons and Natures of Things, whatever they be; we may possibly escape such Difficulties, and at the same time form juster Notions of the Divine Nature and Conduct. According to the former of these Ideas, that unequal Distribution of Good which appears in the World, may be sufficient to puzzle and put to silence every Enquirer: According to the latter, it appears perfectly right, and agreeable to the Natures of Things. The Order of the Universe requires it; and this, if I mistake not, is a just Solution of the Difficulty. I shall leave it to the Reader to apply this Principle, in conjunction with the other, to the several Questions and Difficulties arising from the Frame of the World, and the present Constitution of Things; but a few of the chief of them will, however, be considered under this, or the following Heads.

<strong>The</strong> principal Difficulty belonging to this Head, which I therefore single out from the rest, is raised from that natural <em>Liberty or Free-Agency</em> which Man is possessed of. And the Question is, How it is consistent with the Goodness or Rectitude of the Deity, to commit Mankind to their own Custody and Government; and to put it in their Power to do much Mischief to one another, and to ruin themselves? Why are they entrusted with so dangerous a Faculty; which is so often misapplied, and so grievously abused? Now tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it is confessed, that this is the true <em>Origin of Evil</em>; yet the righteous Creator is in no degree chargeable with such a Consequence. It is perfectly agreeable to the <em>Reasons of Things</em>, and by Consequence to the <em>Divine Rectitude</em>, to produce <em>free</em> Creatures, and join<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Liberty and Intelligence together. Both the <em>Order</em> of the World, and the <em>Happiness</em> of his Creatures required it, notwithstanding the ill Effects which may and do flow from it.

<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> <em>To this Passage, and another of the same Nature, it has been objected, in a late valuable Performance, That</em> the true Idea of Liberty, ought first to have been cleared and distinguished; <em>forasmuch as</em> that Liberty which is the Foundation of the Tryal of Rational Creatures, means something more than the Self-determining Power here spoken of.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>I acknowledge the Pertinence and Justness of this Observation; neither will I pretend to justify the Omission. As in relation to the</em> Order of the Universe, <em>I had occasion to distinguish in the manner here mentioned; so in respect of the other Points before me, it would have been not improper.

Such a Liberty essentially belongs to the All perfect Being, and to him only. In respect of finite Agents, it seems to be the Reward, partly natural and partly positive, of a successful State of Tryal.</em></span>
</aside>
<strong>I</strong> have already observed, That the Deity, in creating the World, seems to have been, in some sense, obliged to frame it after such a manner, as might be altogether worthy of Himself; worthy of His infinite Wisdom, and conformable to the Perfection of his own Ideas: That he could not approve his own Work, without regarding and consulting the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [<em>Order</em>] | <em>Order</em></span></span> <em>Order</em> of the Universe. How then could that <em>Order</em> have been established, or how the System of Creatures compleated, if no <em>Liberty</em> had been granted, no <em>Agents</em> created? Had neither Men nor Angels been <em>free</em>, they could have been nothing more than conscious <em>Instruments</em>, and intelligent <em>Machines</em>.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> The Scale of Beings would thus have been broken, and vastly imperfect: The All-wise Governor of the World would have had no other than passive Subjects; if those may be called Subjects, who are utterly incapable of Obedience. It must not be said, that, upon this Supposition, they would have been beneath the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Regard; since He can neither despise nor overlook any thing that He has made: <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">made: [but,] | but,</span></span> but, surely, they would have been far less worthy of the Conduct and Superintendance of infinite Wisdom, than <em>free Beings</em>, and rational <em>Agents</em>. It is in the Government of such only, that the Glory and Majesty of the Great Sovereign of the World is, or can be fully displayed. Without <em>Liberty</em>, we can have no Idea of the Divine Administration, but what is, comparatively, low and little. It is <em>Liberty</em> that raises it to such an Height of Dignity, Grandeur, and Importance; that constitutes the Kingdom of the Universe, and renders it worthy of its Infinite Ruler. In short, it is <em>Liberty</em> that animates the Creation, and compleats the Order and Beauty of the whole System.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Is</strong> it then to be supposed, that the Creator could have so little Regard to His own <em>Approbation</em>, His own <em>Glory</em>, as to produce an Universe without any <em>Agents?</em> To produce innumerable Ranks of Creatures; the highest of which were so far from being fit for Him to govern, as to be, in reality, incapable of Government? However they might have been directed by <em>Natural Laws</em>, there would have been no place for <em>Moral</em>; and by Consequence, no room for the highest Acts and Employments of Providence.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If <em>Liberty</em> be the Origin of <em>Evil</em>, it is also the Origin of <em>Good</em>. If it be the Occasion of <em>Disorder</em>, it is the Cause of <em>Order</em>; of all the <em>Moral Order</em> that appears in the World. Had <em>Liberty</em> been excluded, <em>Virtue</em> had been excluded with it. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">it. [And] | And</span></span> And if this had been the Case, the World could have had no Charms, no Beauties sufficient to recommend it to him that made it. In short, all other Powers and Perfections would have been very defective without this, which is truly the Life and Spirit of the whole Creation.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>And</strong> as <em>Liberty</em> is thus requisite in respect of <em>Order</em>, so it is in respect of <em>Happiness</em>; to which it not only conduces, but is essential; so far, I mean, that no Happiness can be perfect, or rise to any considerable Height, without it.---I have already observed, and it is most evident in itself, that without <em>Liberty</em> there could be no <em>Virtue</em>; which in its very Nature requires and pre-supposes Freedom of Choice. By strong Instincts, Propensions, and Pre-determinations, Men might have been moved any way, and driven to any thing. But supposing them not <em>free</em>, they would have been little more than well-directed Machines: They could not have been Moral Agents, could not have been capable of <em>Virtue</em>; which consists, not in being rightly acted upon, but in chusing and acting what is right.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And as <em>Virtue</em> depends upon <em>Liberty</em>; so, in a great measure, does <em>Happiness</em> depend upon <em>Virtue</em>. Had not Men been capable of the latter, they never could have obtained, never have been fitted for high Degrees of the former. The chief Ingredients of Happiness, are only the Growth of this Soil. The purest, the noblest, the sublimest Pleasures which rational Beings are capable <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">capable [of,] | of,</span></span> of, spring from Virtue; and are the genuine Fruits, and peculiar Effects of it. That Self-approbation and Consciousness of Well-doing, which inseparably attend the Love and Practice of Virtue, is a Satisfaction of this kind. It may be looked upon as the Essence of Happiness, as Self-condemnation and Remorse are the Essence of Misery. In like manner, a Sense of the Approbation, Esteem, Love, and Favour of the Supreme Being, which Virtue only can procure; is, or will be, a Source of the most exquisite Delight Which the Mind is capable of receiving. As an Apprehension of his Displeasure and Indignation will produce the most insupportable Anguish.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In Comparison of these, and the like virtuous Satisfactions, the highest Gratifications of Sense, and perhaps the very Entertainments of the Understanding, may be considered as mere Amusements. That, in general, the Pleasures of <em>Reflection</em>, are, in many respects, vastly superior to those of <em>Sensation</em>; can be denied by none but those who are deeply immersed in the one, and great Strangers to the other. And of the Pleasures of Reflection, the far greater Share entirely depends upon <em>Virtue</em>, and directly flows from it. When a virtuous Man turns his Eyes inward upon himself, he is sure to find the purest and sincerest Satisfaction. External Objects, fair and beautiful as they are, can yield no Prospect equal to that which he finds within his own Mind. This Object is not only more excel lent in itself, but is of such a Nature, that the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [Possessor] | Possessor</span></span> Possessor can never grow weary of it, or be cloyed with it. It is moreover always ready, always at command; and he enjoys it, without waiting, whenever he pleases. In short, Virtue not only exalts and refines the Mind, but eminently blesses it; as it yields it those serene, solid and durable Joys, which nothing else could possibly yield: As it brings it likewise, in some measure, to a Resemblance of that Being, who is supremely amiable, and infinitely perfect.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Since</strong> then the Reality of <em>Virtue</em> depends upon Liberty, and the Perfection of <em>Happiness</em> depends upon <em>Virtue</em>; it could never be inconsistent with God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Goodness, or the Rectitude of his Nature, to create Men <em>free</em>. On the contrary, whether the Order of the Universe required it or no, He might have done this from a Principle of <em>Benevolence</em>; as it was necessary for the Advancement and Completion of their Happiness. He well knew that this <em>Freedom</em> might, and would be abused; but how was this a sufficient Reason for with-holding it? Because some Men would make an ill Use of this Privilege, must not others be suffer<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d to make a good one? Must so much Happiness be kept out of the World, in order to prevent that Unhappiness which perverse and vicious Men would bring upon themselves?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Surely no Man can prove that <em>Liberty</em> is productive of more <em>Evil</em> than <em>Good</em>. And should this be supposed true in respect of the Inhabitants of this Globe; yet may not <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">not [the] | the</span></span> the Case be widely different in other Parts of the Universe? What Reason is there to conclude, that rational Beings in general are as dissolute and disobedient as that Race of Mankind to which we belong? On the contrary, there are better grounds to believe, if we consider the whole intelligent System, that <em>Virtue</em> is far more prevalent than <em>Vice</em>; and by consequence, that the good Effects of the one are greatly superior to the ill Effects of the other.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>However</strong>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Difficulties concerning <em>Liberty</em> may be accounted for solely on the Principle of <em>Benevolence</em>; yet this is no Reason for excluding the Principle of <em>Order</em> before insisted on. They seem to me, taken in conjunction mutually to support and strengthen each other. Since the Glory of God required a Production of <em>Order</em>, as well as Provision for <em>Happiness</em>; and since the Order of the World, and the Happiness of its Inhabitants both required the Creation of <em>Agents</em> or free Creatures; well may we conclude it perfectly agreeable to the <em>Divine Rectitude</em> to produce such Beings. Since this Perfection of the Deity determines Him ever to act according to the true <em>Reasons</em> of Things; if the <em>Order</em> of the World be such a <em>Reason</em>, it must, I presume, have its Weight, and be regarded accordingly. How far the one of these Principles is limited and restrained by the other, and how far either may be supposed subservient and subordinate to the other; are, I <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">I [think,] | think,</span></span> think, Questions above Human Determination. My chief Aim is to endeavour to shew the Convenience and Advantage of considering the Moral Perfections of the Deity under the Idea of <em>Rectitude</em>, rather than in the various and mixed Light of many distinct Attributes. Having attempted to do this in respect of the Doctrine of Creation, I shall briefly endeavour it in respect of the Doctrine of 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>PROVIDENCE</em>. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Concerning</strong> which, the principal Difficulties seem to be; <em>the Introduction and Infliction of Natural Evil</em>; and <em>the promiscuous Dispensation of Good and Evil which appears in the World</em>. For as to the <em>Permission of Moral Evil</em>, it is nothing more than a direct Consequence of the original Grant of <em>Liberty</em>. Men had been created <em>free</em> to no purpose, if the Use and Exercise of that Power had not been permitted. If there were wise and good Reasons for the Communication of <em>Liberty</em>, and the Production of <em>Agents</em>, as I have already shewn; the same Reasons must hold for their Continuance and Preservation. And if those Agents continue to be Agents, that is, if they are allowed to <em>use</em> their Natural Freedom, it must be in their Power to <em>abuse</em> it; and every such Abuse is Moral Evil. In short; it seems impossible that any Means should be used for the effectual Prevention or Banishment of <em>Vice</em>, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Vice</em>, [which] | which</span></span> which would not be attended with an effectual Prevention or Banishment of <em>Virtue</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> proceed therefore to consider the <em>Introduction and Infliction of Natural Evil</em>; which will appear either difficult or not difficult to be accounted for, according to the Ideas which we frame of the Divine Perfections. If we conceive the Goodness of God to consist in a certain natural <em>Propension</em>, or <em>Disposition</em>, or something analagous [!!!] thereto; which perpetually inclines Him to communicate Good, and by consequence to produce throughout the Universe all possible Happiness; I can see no way at all of accounting for such Evils, as are most properly so called, and which are most really and truly such. On the other hand, if we consider Divine <em>Goodness</em> as Divine <em>Rectitude</em>, according to the foregoing Explanation; such Evils may not only be accounted for, but appear absolutely necessary for the Accomplishment of those Ends, which cannot fail to be proposed by a righteous Governor of the World.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>NATURAL Evils</em> may be distinguished into <em>real</em> and <em>apparent</em>; or, in other Words, into such as are <em>properly</em>, and such as are <em>improperly</em> so called. By the former, I mean those Evils which are entirely of a <em>penal</em> Nature. By the latter, such as terminate in the Good of the Sufferer. Whatever has such an Effect, is, upon the whole, not Evil but Good, and ought to be so accounted. Natural Evils of this kind are such as either conduce to the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [<em>Improve-</em>] | <em>Improvement</em></span></span> <em>Improvement</em> of the <em>Virtuous</em>, or the <em>Reformation</em> of the <em>Vicious</em>. For I consider only their Effects upon the <em>Mind</em>; and therefore purposely omit such Uses and Tendencies as are of a different Nature.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>How</strong> the Hardships and Distresses which are incident to Mankind in this present State, conduce to <em>Virtue</em>, is very obvious. They give Room and Occasion for the Exercise of many Virtues, which could not otherwise appear, either to the World, or to the Owner himself. Were Men exempted from all Sufferings, how could their <em>Patience</em>, their <em>Fortitude</em>, their <em>Resignation</em> to the Will of God, be manifested or brought to light? In like manner, Opportunities of exercising the amiable Virtues of <em>Humanity</em> and <em>Charity</em>, are chiefly owing to Adversity; as it produces and points out the most proper Objects. The truest and highest Proofs that Men can give of their Benevolence to their Species, are comforting the Miserable, relieving the Indigent, and succouring the Distressed. From these and many other Instances that might be added, it is undeniably evident, that the Sufferings of Life contribute to improve Men in Virtue and Goodness. Such <em>Evils</em> then as these, by producing such Effects, lose their Name and their Nature; and ought to be both called and reputed the greatest <em>Blessings</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>And</strong> the same may be said in respect of those <em>Chastisements</em>, and Corrections, by which Sinners are reclaimed, and brought to a just <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">just [Sense] | Sense</span></span> Sense of their Sin and their Duty. When the Hand of Heaven is upon them, Men are peculiarly disposed to <em>learn Righteousness</em>. Providential Calamities tend, very powerfully, to subdue the Obstinate, and soften the Obdurate: And even the <em>natural Consequences</em> of Sin and Vice are oftentimes instrumental in producing the same Effect. In all such Cases, Mens Sufferings are infinitely beneficial; and however grievous they may be for the present, are in reality no more <em>evil</em>, than a bitter Medicine by which a sick Man recovers his Health. There is therefore very little Difficulty in reconciling such Evils as these with the Divine Goodness; in whatever Light it be viewed, or however it be represented.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> what shall we say of those Evils which are not only judicial, but strictly <em>penal?</em> When, the Measure of Mens Iniquities being filled up, they are actually under the Executions of Divine Vengeance? This is sometimes the Case of incorrigible Offenders, even in this World. What Account then is to be given of these real, absolute Evils; which not only strike by Commission, but are inflicted as direct and positive Punishments? How are they consistent with that <em>Disposition</em> in the Deity, which is supposed ever prompting Him to Acts of Beneficence, and Communications of Good? If it be said that they are intended merely <em>in terrorem</em>; how is such an Assertion to be supported? That they may be, and are, inflicted with such a View, is readily al<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">al- [lowed.] | lowed.</span></span>lowed. But is this the sole Reason and Design of them? The only Intention befitting the righteous Governor of the World? I humbly suppose the contrary. Could we suppose but one Moral Agent, one Rational Creature in the Universe, and him obstinately and incorrigibly wicked; it is not, I think, to be doubted, but he would feel the Effects of his Maker<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Displeasure: Nay, there are good Grounds to believe, that his Punishment would be proportion<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d to his Crimes. This seems highly probable on many Accounts; and is, if I mistake not, conformable to the Doctrines both of Reason and Revelation.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> is owing, I presume, to mistaken Conceptions of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Goodness</em>, that Men are apt to consider Him as incapable of inflicting Punishment with any other than the fore-mentioned View. If we attend to the Principle of Divine <em>Rectitude</em>, which comprehends all Moral Perfections, and, I think, exhibits them in a clearer Light; we shall find the Deity ever acting, and ever determined to act, according to the <em>Reason of the Thing</em>, and the <em>Right of the Case</em>. If then it be <em>right</em> and <em>reasonable</em> in itself to punish <em>Wickedness</em>, as well as to reward <em>Goodness</em>, He will assuredly do both. If <em>Virtue</em> be necessarily <em>amiable</em> in his Sight, <em>Vice</em> is necessarily odious. If there be <em>Merit</em> in the one, which naturally recommends it to his Favour and Esteem; there is equal <em>Demerit</em> in the other, which unavoidably excites his Displeasure and Indignation. Is it not then as <em>morally fit</em>, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [as] | as</span></span> as agreeable to the Rectitude and Sanctity of the Divine Nature to punish the one, as to reward the other?

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Should</strong> God communicate Good, and finally dispense Happiness to all his Creatures, deserving or undeserving, promiscuously and indiscriminately; how could He be said, upon this Supposition, to act according to the true Natures and Reasons of Things? <em>Virtue</em> and <em>Vice</em> are essentially opposite; and therefore it is not possible that the same Treatment should suit the Votaries of each. Between <em>Virtue</em> and <em>Happiness</em>, <em>Vice</em> and <em>Unhappiness</em>, there is both a Natural and Moral Connexion. A <em>vicious</em> Man cannot, in the Nature of Things, be <em>happy</em>; and if he could, the righteous Governor of the World would not finally suffer it, because the quite contrary is deserved. It would appear to Him a direct Misapplication and Prostitution of Happiness, to confer it on such an Object. To bless the Impenitent and Incorrigible, must be essentially repugnant to the Rectitude and Purity of his Nature. The eternal Reasons of Things, which constitute the sacred Rule of Righteousness, will not admit of it.

<strong>When</strong> a virtuous Man hears or reads of a vile and villainous Character, he naturally resents, and is offended at it: And the more virtuous he is, and the viler the Character is, the higher his Indignation rises in Proportion. This may be looked upon as the Operation of an <em>Instinct</em>, or <em>Passion</em>, planted in Mens Minds <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Minds [for] | for</span></span> for such a Purpose: And, in some measure, so it is. But it is to be considered, that this <em>instinctive Resentment</em> is distinct from, and subsequent to, the <em>Disapprobation</em> of the <em>Understanding</em>. <em>Vice</em> necessarily appears odious to the <em>Judgment</em> of every uncorrupt Mind; and that <em>natural Movement</em> which in us follows such a Perception, no way alters or affects the Perception itself; which must be the same with or without such a Passion. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> therefore the Deity be void of all Passion, yet <em>Vice</em> must be the Object of his extreme Abhorrence. The Perfection of his Understanding heightens its Deformity, and renders it infinitely offensive.---Let us further consider the Sentiments of a virtuous Man, in respect of a very base Character. He not only perceives it to be very odious in itself, but judges it immediately most worthy of <em>Punishment</em>. Let us suppose the Case of some Wretch who has murdered his Father, or ruined his Country, or sacrificed the Lives of his Children to some mean Passion. I inquire not what Emotions of Resentment would rise in a good Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Breast, upon the first hearing or reading of such Crimes. I only ask, how he would judge of them in cool Blood? Could he possibly desire or approve the Impunity of such a Criminal? It may be said, that if his Punishment were not necessary <em>in terrorem</em>, that a good Man would incline to grant him an Opportunity of Repentance and Amendment. Be it so. But if it be further supposed, that such a Criminal <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Criminal [is] | is</span></span> is altogether hardened and incorrigible, and that the longer he lives the more wicked he grows; the most merciful Man in the Worlds if it were in his Power, would pass Sentence on him, and give him up to condign Punishment. To do otherwise, would not be Goodness, but Weakness: It would be violating Truth and Nature, and acting counter to the plainest Reasons of Things.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If then the Punishment of incorrigible Sinners be <em>right</em> and <em>reasonable</em> in itself, it must be <em>morally fit</em> for God to inflict it; and by Consequence, it can be no way<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> unbecoming, but is highly becoming the Rectitude of his Government, and the Perfection of his Providence. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we are sure it is more agreeable to the Deity to spare than to punish, whenever the Case will admit of it; yet, whenever it will not, He certainly punishes: because Punishing is then <em>right</em>, and Sparing <em>wrong</em>. And if doing what is <em>right</em> be true <em>Goodness</em>, then God is equally <em>Good</em> in both Dispensations.

<strong>I</strong> think it appears, from what has been said, how little Reason there is to wonder at the Introduction of <em>Natural Evil</em>. For, without inquiring whether it be not an unavoidable Consequence of our Capacity for <em>Natural Good</em>, and without considering what <em>Natural</em> Ends and Uses are served by it; it seems abundantly sufficient, that it answers the <em>Moral</em> Purposes above mentioned; that it is necessary for the Exercise and <em>Improvement</em> of Mens <em>Virtues</em>; for the <em>Correction</em> of the <em>Corrigible</em>, and the <em>Punishment</em> of the <em>Incorrigible</em>. I before observed, that to create Intelligent Beings without <em>Liberty</em>, or to debar them the Use of it, would be to shut <em>Virtue</em> out of the World; and, by Conse<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Conse- [quence,] | quence,</span></span>quence, <em>Happiness</em>, in a great measure. This <em>Liberty</em> then being abused, and <em>Moral Evil</em> introduced; <em>Natural Evil</em> became not only useful, but necessary. When Men have corrupted their Nature, and plunged themselves in Sin and Guilt, they will either be reformed, or they will not. If they will not, <em>Suffering</em> becomes their Due, their just Lot, and unavoidable Portion. If they will, it is commonly owing to <em>Suffering</em>; which, in all Moral Distempers, is the strongest and most prevailing Remedy in the World. And since it is thus effectual in restoring lost Men, and bringing them back to their Duty; little Reason is there to repine at it; and much less to turn it into an Objection against Providence. Reason informs us, that Mens Wills are not to be forced; and Experience assures us, that gentle Means are often unavailing. It was necessary therefore to have recourse to this sharper Expedient; which might, consistently with Liberty, reduce unthinking Sinners, and reconcile them to the Paths of Virtue.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> is chiefly owing to these <em>Natural Evils</em>, if they may be called such, that this Life is properly <em>a State of Discipline</em>. The principal Intentions of our All-righteous Governor, are to improve the Virtuous, and reclaim the Vicious, by such Ways and Means as are suited to the Nature of Free-Agents. To these Ends the Dispensations of his Providence are most wisely adapted. Accordingly Gentleness and Severity are separately used, or mixed, as <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">as [Cases] | Cases</span></span> Cases and Occasions require. But the Evils of Life are so useful and beneficial, so necessary for the Accomplishment of both these Ends, that it is no wonder they are suffered to prevail and spread as they generally do. The best Men stand in need of them, not only for the Exercise and Improvement of their Virtues, but often-times for the Security of their Innocence; and sometimes for the Cure of secret Faults, and latent Corruptions. And as to those who have gone astray, and departed further from their Duty; their Return, if they have returned, has generally been owing to the Discipline of Suffering. Whoever are not to be wrought upon by this powerful Remedy, may be reckoned incurable, and their Case desperate.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> if this Life be a <em>State of Discipline</em> in respect of the virtuous or reclaimable Part of Mankind, it is universally <em>a State of Trial</em>. It seems, indeed, highly probable, not only that all Men, but all Moral Agents whatever, are obliged to undergo some kind of Probation. Such a State is, in some measure, a necessary Consequence of Intelligence and Liberty, in finite and imperfect Beings; unless they be so situated and circumstanced, as to be out of the Reach of all Temptation. We know that even good Men will hereafter be thus secured, notwithstanding they retain both their Freedom and Fallibility. When <em>Virtue</em> and <em>Pleasure</em> shall be entirely on the same side, Attracting the Mind with united Force, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [nothing] | nothing</span></span> nothing on the other side to draw against them; it is easy to conceive, that in such a State there can be no danger of going astray. But this is a State of <em>Reward</em> and <em>Victory</em>, not of <em>Trial</em> and Conflict[???]. Nor can any Reason be assigned, why God should fix his intelligent Creatures in such a Condition as this, at their first setting out; and before they have done any thing at all to deserve it, or prepare themselves for it. It was not fitting they should obtain such a Prize, or be allowed such a Triumph, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>till they had been found, in some Sense, in some Degree, <em>worthy</em>. Perfect Happiness was and ought to be reserved for the proper Objects for God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Love and Favour; which none of his Creatures could be, without virtuous Qualifications, and moral Merit: and these imply a State of <em>Probation</em>. Those Servants of his, whether Men or Angels, whose <em>Obedience</em> and <em>Fidelity</em> have been <em>proved</em> and <em>tried</em>, are truly amiable in the Sight of God: These are real Objects of his Esteem and Love; and, as such, are, or will be justly distinguished by proportionable Degrees of Happiness and Glory. To confer the same Happiness on the <em>Unfaithful</em> and <em>Disobedient</em>, would be a manifest Violation of Truth and Nature; since it would be treating those Beings alike, between whom there is the greatest Difference in the World. By Parity of Reason, it was morally unfit to treat those who had never been <em>tried</em>, and, by Consequence, merited nothing, in the same manner as if they <nobr>had <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">had [been] | been</span></span> been</nobr> tried, and found faithful. Are Rewards due to the Righteous, and Punishments to the Wicked? Those who have never been tried, can deserve neither; and therefore cannot, agreeably to Truth and Rectitude, be treated like either of the other. They are, in a moral Sense, <em>worthless</em>; and, by Consequence, are in a Station as much below <em>Merit</em>, as it is above <em>Demerit</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To discover further the Rectitude and Fitness of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Proceedings in relation to his Creatures, let us endeavour to illustrate this Matter, by a Similitude taken from the low Concerns of human Life. Let us suppose, under any wise Master of a Family, three Servants thus differently qualified and circumstanced: One of them has approved himself by long-tried Fidelity, Diligence, and Discretion; another has been found false, perfidious, and slothful; and a third is newly entered into Service, and as yet untried: Would not this last be dealt with in a quite different manner from either the first or the second? that is, in a middle way between the Affection shewn to the one, and the Rigour used toward the other? His Master would treat him with Humanity, give him all fitting Encouragement, and let him want nothing that he could reasonably expect. But, surely, that Esteem, that Good-Will and Kindness which was shewn to the tried Merit of the first, would not be shewn to the third, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>till he had been tried likewise. To suppose otherwise, is to suppose that a wise Man either could not, or would <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">would [not] | not</span></span> not distinguish between experienced Worth, and Qualities untried. It is to suppose, that a Course of faithful Services, and dutiful Behaviour, stand for nothing, and are of no Value at all.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Universe is God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Family, and Moral Agents are His Servants; who obtain His Favour, or incur His Displeasure, according as they demean themselves. He has given them to understand what He expects from them, and what they may expect from Him, either in Case of Obedience, or Disobedience. And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they are utterly incapable of doing Him any real Service, and in that respect are all <em>unprofitable Servants</em>; yet forasmuch as Obedience and Virtue, perfect or imperfect, are in themselves proportionably amiable and good, and Disobedience and Vice the contrary; God approves, or disapproves, accordingly. Even Men are enabled to recommend themselves, and find Favour in His Sight; and, through the Merits of their Redeemer, their faithful Endeavours, however imperfect, are <em>counted to them for Righteousness</em>.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Here</strong> perhaps it may be objected, That the <em>Divine Prescience</em> seems to supersede all <em>Trials</em>, and render them wholly needless. To what purpose does God fix his Creatures in such a State, if he ever foreknew the Behaviour of them all, even to the minutest Action? I answer, That such a Foreknowledge implies the Reality of those Actions which are the Objects of it; since it is impossible to fore<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">fore- [know] | know</span></span>know what is never to be.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But as God is <em>omniscient</em> as well as <em>prescient</em>, must we not conclude that he clearly sees, not only what ever <em>will</em> actually be, but whatever would be upon every Supposition? And if He certainly knows how any of His Creatures would behave themselves in any imaginable State; what Occasion can there be for the Production of such a State, or any farther Trial? In answer to this, I observe in the first Place, that no Knowledge whatever, does, or can make any Alteration in the Objects thereof. For all Knowledge is Perception; and Perception being no Action, nothing can be effected by it. If then no Creature can deserve either well or ill at the Hands of his Creator till he come to exercise his Liberty or free Choice; the Omniscience of the Deity cannot make him, in any Degree, either meritorious, or guilty. Whatever may be known, or foreknown; no Merit or Demerit can be antecedent to Choice and Action. God knows that a certain Creature will, or would, if left to his Liberty, and put to the Test, behave wisely and well. What follows from hence? Does it follow, that the Merit of such a Conduct, or such an Agent, is antecedent to his <em>Trial?</em> If it does, then it will follow, that it was antecedent to his <em>Existence</em>; since an Agent may as well be supposed to merit before he exists, as before he acts. The Divine Knowledge precedes both, but operates no way. It cannot therefore supersede actual <em>Probation</em>; <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Probation</em>; [without] | without</span></span> without which no Creature can really deserve any Thing.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I would further ask, whether it be <em>right</em>, and reasonable, to <em>punish</em> the foreseen <em>Crimes</em> of any Agent before they be committed? If it be right, then our first Parents would never have enter<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d into Paradise; or if they did enter, their Sentence might as well have been passed and executed before the Fall as after it. If it be not right to <em>punish</em> foreseen <em>Crimes</em> before they be committed; how can it be right, to <em>reward</em> foreseen <em>Virtues</em> before they be practised, or acquired? If no Agent can contract Guilt, or deserve <em>Punishment</em>, before he have done amiss; neither can any Agent deserve Favour or <em>Reward</em>, till he have done well. He may enjoy Degrees of Good, and partake of the Blessings of Heaven, antecedently to any Merit; or any Trial; but that supreme Felicity, that indefectible State, wherein consist the Rewards of the Righteous, could not, I suppose, consistently with the <em>Divine Rectitude</em>, have been conferred on any <em>untried</em> Creatures. This is their peculiar Portion, partly by God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Appointment, and partly from the very Nature of the Thing.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;For, in the last place, since a State of Probation is necessary for the Exercise and Improvement of Virtue; it is, by Consequence, necessary for the Consummation and Perfection of Happiness. As the Favour of God, and the positive Rewards consequent thereupon, were not to be obtained without Virtue nor Virtue without Trial: so the same may be said of the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [<em>Natural</em>] | <em>Natural</em></span></span> <em>Natural Effects</em> of Virtue; which, as I before observed, are essential to the Happiness of all Rational Beings. Virtue is properly the Health of the Mind; and no Pleasures what ever can be sound or sincere without it. To which must be added, that it yields Pleasures of its own more valuable than all other Things can possibly afford. Whatever therefore is requisite to the Production, Increase, or Exaltation of Virtue, may be looked upon as the Foundation of Happiness. And from hence it appears, how unreasonable it is to complain either of a <em>State of Trial</em> in general, or of those <em>Natural Evils</em> in particular, which belong to it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>And</strong> if this Life is to be consider<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d as a <em>State of Trial</em>, and Preparation for another; it cannot be difficult to account for <em>the promiscuous Dispensation of Good and Evil</em> which appears in it. This was indeed formerly reckoned the principal Difficulty concerning <em>Providence</em>; insomuch that many wise and good Men stumbled at it, and very hardly recovered themselves. But the Reason was, because <em>a Future State</em> was then, in a great measure, undiscovered. And indeed if the Existence of Mankind terminated with this present Life; it would not only be difficult, but impossible to explain this Matter, or reconcile it with the Rectitude of the Divine Administration. On the other hand, since we have been assured of another Life, the present Order and Distribution of Things is no longer <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">longer [a My-] | a Mystery</span></span> a Mystery. There is nothing in it that needs to disquiet or perplex our Minds; nothing that is unsuitable to our Condition and Circumstances. The very Irregularities complained of, only seem to be such; and are, in themselves, perfectly right and fit. Whatever Objections may be drawn from them, they all admit of an easy Solution, if we do but at tend to this important Truth; <em>viz</em>. Trial and Discipline are our Business in this World; Judgment and Retribution are reserved for the next.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> whatever be the Force of this general Reason, there may be also particular Reasons for the Dispensations we are speaking of, arising from the different Circumstances of Mankind. And if there be, they cannot fail to be regarded by the righteous Governor of the World; whom I have all along considered as directing his Proceedings by the entire Reasons of Things. We cannot but observe, that there is an endless Variety of Cases among Mankind, who differ so much in their Constitutions, Inclinations, Customs, and Ways of Life; that both their Virtues and Vices are almost infinitely diversified: insomuch that it may be justly questioned, whether any two Cases be exactly alike; or any two Men admit of the same Providential Treatment. Here then is a Labyrinth in which our weak Minds are easily lost. No Man living throughly [!!!] understands the Case of any one Individual in the whole Species; not excepting even his <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">his [own.] | own.</span></span> own. How then should we presume to judge of the Dispensations of Providence? Every Man is dealt with suitably, and fitly, and according to <em>the Right of his Case:</em> and the Right of his Case is compounded of various <em>Reasons</em>, some past, some present, and some future; some respecting himself, and others his Fellow-Creatures. We are so far from discovering all these Reasons, that perhaps we see none of them. To determine therefore what Means and Methods are proper to be used, in relation to ourselves, and the World about us, is as much out of our Power, as to count the Rays of the Sun, or the Sands on the Sea-shore.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> we can form no Judgment concerning Individuals, nor find out what particular Dispensations are most suitable to their respective Cases; yet if we consider the present and future State of Mankind, and the Relation which the one bears to the other; we may easily discover what is sufficient to satisfy our Minds, either about the <em>Sufferings</em> of the <em>Righteous,</em> or the <em>Prosperities</em> of the <em>Wicked</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Supposing then that the <em>Righteous</em> here spoken of, are, according to the Measures of Humanity, really such; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> this is a Point not always so clear, nor so easy to be determined, as is commonly imagined: but supposing them, I say, really to be, what they are reputed; yet it may sometimes be very fit for them to suffer in this Life. Some Reasons for it are very obvious; and many others there <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">there [may] | may</span></span> may be which we cannot discover. It has been already observed, that <em>Sufferings</em> do in many respects befriend <em>Virtue</em>. That they afford many Occasions for the Exercise of it, and many Opportunities for its Growth and Improvement. To which must be added, that by producing many illustrious Examples of Patience, Fortitude, and Submission; they place Virtue in a most amiable Light; and thereby contribute to recommend it to the Publick, and propagate it among Mankind. Were this Life a Scene either of uninterrupted <em>Enjoyments</em>, or continual <em>Sufferings</em>; many Virtues must have lain dormant, or rather unproduced, through the Want of Objects and Opportunities. But that just Mixture which Providence has ordained; enlarges Mens Sphere of Action, and calls forth every Virtue. They have hereby room to employ all their Affections, and exert all their Powers. Nothing therefore could be more suitable to our present State of Discipline and Trial, than those very Dispensations which we are considering.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Again, the Sufferings of the Righteous are to be considered likewise as <em>Correctives</em>. The best Men have their Faults and Failings; which not only blemish their Characters, but injure their Minds. In proportion as their Virtue is obstructed by them, their Happiness must be diminished. This therefore is another just Reason for the Interposition of Providence, in any such Manner as might be most effectual. Good Men are peculiarly the Ob<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Ob- [jects] | jects</span></span>jects of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Care and Concern; who will therefore omit nothing, consistently with Liberty, that may contribute to their greater Purity and Perfection. Frail as they are, they are the Top of Mankind, and the Flower of our Species; and as such, Providence may be supposed, as it were, sollicitous in their Behalf; and particularly engaged in cleansing their Minds, and rooting out the Remains of Sin and Corruption. And what Expedient so proper for this Purpose as <em>Affliction</em> and <em>Adversity?</em> Nothing searches deeper; nothing produces greater Attention, or more careful Recollection; nothing tends more to purify Mens Affections, or to bring the whole Mind to a right Frame. Thus, for Instance, that Attachment to Sense, and the Enjoyments of this World, which is often too strong even in the best Men, is no way so effectually loosened as by <em>suffering</em>. This recalls, and fixes, their devious Thoughts, and wandering Desires; and puts them upon reflecting, in a more particular manner, where they are, and whither they are going. It greatly contributes to remove Mens Hearts and Affections from <em>Things below</em>, and raise them to <em>Things above:</em> to convince them of the Vanities of this Life, and make them earnest and unwearied in the Pursuit of a better.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But further, these Demerits of good Men which require these Providential <em>Corrections</em>, render them also obnoxious to real <em>Punishment</em>. They are <em>Sufferers</em> because they are <em>Sinners:</em> And this is another <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">another [Reason,] | Reason,</span></span> Reason, distinct from the former, for the Hardships and Adversities which are brought upon them. As all Men have sinned, and fallen short of their Duty, they must all be liable to Punishment; which may at any time be inflicted on them within the Bounds of Proportion. Every Instance, every Degree of Sin, is a just Ground for suitable Punishment, whether the Ends and Intentions of Government require it or no. The Virtues of good Men may not always indemnify them here; however they may contribute to secure them hereafter. But is not the Great, the Universal Sacrifice abundantly sufficient to answer both these Purposes? To avert entirely the Indignation of Heaven, and purchase an Exemption from all Punishment? This can only be said of those who punctually comply with the Terms of the Gospel, and discharge the Duties required of them. Now, there may be even in good Christians, in respect of these Gospel-Conditions, lesser Failures and Deficiencies; which may affect them in this Life, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> not in the next: which may deserve, and therefore justify, the Judgments of Heaven, and the Animadversions of Providence. In short, whatever Favour and Acceptance they may find in a Future State, they may not wholly escape at present. On the contrary, they may justly be punished; and such a Proceeding is perfectly agreeable to the Reasons of Things, and the Truth of their Case. Since their Virtues and Graces greatly <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">greatly [over-] | over-balance</span></span> over-balance their Defects; since they are faithful and obedient in the main, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they <em>offend in many Things:</em> This fully both accounts for their Sufferings here, and their Success hereafter.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> am next to consider the <em>Prosperity of the Wicked</em>. And here again I must observe, that, in some Cases, it may be difficult to determine who are <em>wicked</em>; and still more difficult to determine what is <em>Prosperity</em>. Supposing a Man to be notoriously <em>wicked</em>, how can we certainly know when he is <em>prosperous?</em> Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he abound in the Goods and Enjoyments of Life, they may, to him, be very insipid, and by Consequence, avail nothing: His Mind may be so disordered and disturbed, that he cannot relish them: In the midst of the greatest Affluence, he may have such secret Pangs and Anxieties, as render him a Burden and a Torment to himself. But supposing it otherwise, and that he does enjoy the Goods in his Possession; they may be far from amounting to any real <em>Prosperity</em>. If they sooth him in his Sins, and harden him in his Wickedness, they are, in Effect, not Blessings, but Judgments; and may be considered as the Beginning of his Punishment. Either a wicked Man is capable of being reclaimed by the Favours and Bounties of Providence, or he is not; if he be, the <em>Reason</em> of his <em>Prosperity</em> is plain, and surely we need not seek for any ether. If he be not, he neither does nor can <em>prosper</em>, whatever he <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">he [possesses:] | possesses:</span></span> possesses: All his Goods, and all his Enjoyments, are only so many gilded Misfortunes; since they add to his Guilt, and hasten his Ruin. On Men of incorrigible and reprobate Minds, Prosperity is not <em>conferred</em> by Providence, but judicially <em>inflicted:</em> It is, to them, a Snare, a Delusion; which, by blinding their Understandings, and fettering their Inclinations, renders their Case the more desperate. In reality therefore, it is not, in respect of such Men, a gentle Dispensation, but a very severe one. It may justly be considered as a Part of their Punishment, and a Prelude to their Destruction.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Prosperity of such Men be really, and in the Issue of Things, calamitous and penal; yet still it implies, at present, some Kinds and Degrees of Enjoyment. Perhaps then it may be asked, What Connexion or Congruity there is between Guilt and Pleasure? How it is consistent with the Rectitude of the Deity, considered as Governor of the World, to dispense any sort of Good to obstinate and incurable Offenders? Not to repeat the Reason already given for such Dispensations; I answer, That as no Man is so virtuous as never to do amiss; so no Man is so vicious as never to do well. It is not to be imagined, that all the Actions of his Life should be a continued Series of Transgressions: Some Parts, some Instances of his Conduct, must be supposed laudable, and in a lower Degree virtuous. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> therefore his Vices, being greatly predominant, expose him <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">him [to] | to</span></span> to the Indignation of Heaven, and will, if continued in, involve him in great Miseries <em>hereafter</em>; yet why may not some Indulgence, some Favour be shewn him <em>here</em>, on account of that Good which he is supposed to have done? If he have any Virtue, any good Quality, any commendable Actions; why may they not, abstracting all other Considerations, be so far regarded, as to procure him that Shadow of Prosperity which we are here speaking of? A Prosperity that only affords him a few broken Pleasures, and transient Enjoyments; which amuse him for a little while, and then vanish for ever.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Besides</strong> these Reasons for the Sufferings of the Righteous, and the Prosperity of the Wicked, which are peculiar to each; others may be assigned that are common to them both. Neither, perhaps, may be sent on any personal Account, but be entirely owing to some social Relation. The Righteous may suffer, and the Wicked prosper, merely through the Merits or Demerits of their Parents, their Princes, or the Community to which they belong. Thus we find in Fact, that good Men are often involved in publick or domestick Calamities; and ill Men often included in Blessings obtained by other Hands. This is sometimes an unavoidable Consequence of the present Frame and Constitution of Things; and when it befalls Men by divine Appointment, wise and good Ends are promoted by it; as might be shewn at large.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">large. [<strong>Again</strong>:] | <strong>Again</strong>:</span></span> Again: It deserves to be more-especially considered, that if Mens Virtues and good Actions were immediately rewarded, and their Vices and Crimes immediately punished; If this, I say, was the general and stated Rule of Providential Dispensations; such a Weight would be laid upon Mens Wills, as would leave little or no room for a Moral Choice, and, by Consequence, for Virtue. What Man would dare to commit a vile or vicious Action, if he was sure that a Judgment from Heaven was to be the immediate Consequence? if the Sword of Justice hung visibly over his Head, ready to fall upon him the very next Instant? If Mankind were overawed by such a powerful Check, such an irresistible Restraint as this; the Commission of a Crime would be almost impracticable. On the other hand: If virtuous Actions brought a Providential Recompence along with them, Men would greedily run into them merely from a Principle of Interest. Human Virtue would then be entirely mercenary; and those pure Motives, whereon its Worth chiefly depends, quite out of sight. In short; such a Supposition is utterly inconsistent with a State of Trial; as bringing Men under a moral <em>Necessity</em> of discharging their Duty.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Thus we see, those <em>promiscuous Dispensations</em> which appear in the World, are not only consistent with the <em>Divine Rectitude</em>, but perfectly agreeable to it; as being grounded on the true Reasons of Things, and resulting from the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [Nature] | Nature</span></span> Nature of Virtue and Vice, and the Frame and Faculties of Human Minds.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> know not whether it be needful to take notice of the Objection which is sometimes raised from the <em>Inequality of Mens Conditions</em> in this Life. The Reasons of it are so obvious; or rather, it is so manifestly necessary for the Well-being, and perhaps the very Being of Society, that any Man may soon satisfy his <em>Understanding</em> about it, whatever Trouble he may find in silencing his <em>Passions</em>. Nothing is more evident, than that if Mankind were reduced to an Equality, and set upon a Level, the Affairs of the World would either stand still, or run into the utmost Confusion.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But supposing it a Matter indifferent to Society, whether the Conditions of Men were equal, or unequal; there is good Reason to believe that the present Inequality would still have prevailed upon other Accounts. As the <em>Order</em> and the Harmony of the World require a Variety and Subordination of <em>Kinds</em>, so the same may be said in respect of <em>Individuals</em>. In both Cases, such a Subordination is intrinsically more regular and beautiful; and, by Consequence, contributes to the Perfection of the Universe.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It promotes likewise <em>Moral Good</em>, by affording such Occasions of exercising Mens Virtues, and improving their Minds, as could not have been had without it. Moderation, Contentment, Humility, and the like Virtues, depend, in a great measure, on these Inequalities of Mens Fortunes and Con<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Con- [ditions;] | ditions;</span></span>ditions; which may therefore be looked upon not only as requisite, but essential to a State of Probation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Such an Appointment then is highly becoming the Wisdom of Divine Providence; I mean, as far as Providence is concerned in this Matter. For, in truth, many Events relating to it, are only permitted, not ordained. Men often diversify their Conditions themselves; and differ more from each other in the Externals of Life, than Providence ever intended. Some throw themselves from a high Station to a low one, by Folly and Misconduct: Others climb the Heights of Ambition, by Ways and Paths of their own making. And thus the Distinctions of Life are multiplied and widened, merely through Mens vicious Desires, and criminal Pursuits. Providence suffers these Revolutions, but determines them not; and therefore is not answerable for them, or the Consequences of them. And, indeed, not only these Differences of Condition, but many of the Hardships and Distresses which befal Mankind, are the Fruits of their own Folly; and should be placed to the Account, not of Divine Providence, but Human Perverseness. However, a regular Subordination being right, fit, and amiable in itself, may well be considered as God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Ordinance, who has made evident Provision for it, in that Diversity of Talents and Natural Endowments which appears throughout our whole Species. The original Disparities of their Minds naturally <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">naturally [tend] | tend</span></span> tend to produce different Circumstances and Conditions of Life.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But it may not be improper to add, that these Distinctions are far less material than is commonly imagined. In respect of the most valuable Enjoyments, and the principal Blessings of Life, Men are nearly Equal. The Advantages and Privileges of the Great, have more Shew than Substance, and depend very much on Fancy and Opinion. Those Gratifications which are peculiar to them, are often very much encumbered; often purchased at the Price of more solid Satisfactions. Happiness is so far from being in Proportion to Greatness, that many Men, when they rise in the World, leave it behind them. They frequently exchange natural Appetites, and natural Enjoyments, for artificial ones; which having no Bounds but those of Imagination, Men are easily bewildered in the Pursuit of them. While they are grasping at fantastick Objects, they overlook real ones; and thus catch nothing in the End but Vanity and Vexation. What is commonly said of the Covetous, may be justly applied, though in a different Sense, to many Men in the upper Stations of Life; the more they possess, the less they enjoy. In short, all Things considered, there is good Reason to conclude, that the Inequality of Mens Conditions in this World, is far greater in Appearance, than it is in Reality.

<div class="indented numbered">
SIR,
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
IF, instead of answering the Questions you are pleased to ask me, I should refer you to abler Hands; and desire to be excused; there might perhaps be more Discretion, and Modesty, in such a Proceeding; but certainly less Respect. On this Account I chuse to send you an Answer, however short and imperfect, rather than an Apology. Since you have given yourself the Trouble to call for <em>my</em> Sentiments; <em>mine</em> you shall have. If they turn to no other Account; they will, at least, convince you of my Inclination and Readiness to gratify you.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I ought indeed, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">indeed, [not] | not</span></span>not only in point of Good-Manners, but from a higher Principle, to <em>be always ready to give an Answer to every Man that asked me a Reason of the Hope that is in</em> me. And if every Man has such a Claim; you have a double one. Though I think it a Happiness to differ from you in Matters of Religion; it is my Desire, and my Ambition, to agree with you as much as possible in other Respects. As you profess the Obligations of Humanity; so it is your Praise to excel in the Discharge of them. As I profess a higher Rule; it will be my Fault, and my Shame, if I be not equally observant of it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But I must bespeak your Excuse; if, in answering your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Queries, I communicate my Thoughts plainly and freely. To disbelieve what the rest of Mankind hold sacred, is one thing; to revile, or ridicule it, is another. <em>Licentiousness</em> can have no Plea; <em>Liberty</em> never wants a good one. While he practises the former, he may well allow of the latter.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to begin my Task; your first Question is a general one.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
1. <em>WHAT do I think of a late Book entitled</em>, <strong>Christianity as Old as the Creation?</strong>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Before I pass any Judgment of the <em>Book</em>, give me leave to propose an Emendation in the <em>Title</em>. It should have been, if I mistake not, <em>Christianity older than the Creation:</em> or rather, <em>Christianity before all Ages</em>. The <em>moral</em> Part of it, which is our Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Subject, being a System of Eternal Truths, could neither commence at the Crea<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Crea- [tion,] | tion,</span></span>tion, nor at any other Time. It must have been <em>as old as</em> the Divine Understanding; that is, have coexisted with it from Everlasting. I do not pretend, in saying this, to be ignorant of the Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Meaning. But it may deserve to be considered, whether such an Impropriety would be suffered in the Title of so pompous a Book.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However, I ask pardon for this short Digression, and proceed to your Query.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
As to the <em>Book</em> itself, I think it needless to take notice of the old Leaven which appears working in it. It is Folly to expect, that <em>Antichristian</em> Authors should not be <em>Anticlerical:</em> unless, Sir, <em>you</em> would think fit to Write; and set as good an Example by your Pen, as you have often done by Word of Mouth. I never knew you fix a Censure on the whole Order. If you blame some; you never fail to give others their Due. And indeed so does your Author, occasionally. But in you it is Honesty; in him it is Art. To shew us that this is only a Copy of his Countenance; his Invectives are generally so contrived, as to comprehend the whole Profession, and take in every Man. But this is a gentle Persecution; or rather none at all: Such Accusations as these always carrying their own Confutation along with them. Setting aside therefore this Part of the Book, as foreign to both your Purpose and mine; I proceed to the Argumentative.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Argumentative. [<strong>This</strong>] | <strong>This</strong></span></span>
<strong>This</strong> then appears to me, after the most careful and unprejudiced Perusal; to have far more Colour than Strength; far more Shew than Substance. It seems indeed fair and clear toward the Surface; but whoever looks deeper into it, will find Mire and Mud rising in great Abundance. The Arguments are often specious, and sometimes subtle; but seldom sound. They either conclude nothing, or nothing but what is universally allowed. When he meets with Points which make against him; he walks over them silently, or strikes off another way. Such as make for him, or seem to do so; he fetches at any distance. When Materials for Reasoning are wanting; the Reader is frequently put off with empty Declamations, or artful Harangues. Nor can I avoid charging the Author with great Confusion of Ideas, and an unaccountable Misrepresentation both of Men and Things.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To make good the several Parts of this Charge by an Induction of Particulars, would carry me beyond the Bounds of your Patience, as well as of my Leisure. But various Instances will be produced in the Course of this Letter: and, in the mean time, Sir, take this Specimen.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>The</strong> two following Propositions may be looked upon as the main Pillars of his Scheme; the one, that <em>the Law of Nature is perfect and unchangeable</em>; and the other, that <em>all Men are naturally capable of discovering it</em>. The former is true, if rightly explained; the latter <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">latter [wants] | wants</span></span> wants Distinctions and Limitations.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But for the present, let them both pass undisputed. What is it that he infers from them? If I understand him, it is; that <em>the Gospel is needless, and all Revelation superfluous</em>. The better to make appear the Wideness of this Conclusion, and the Weakness of the Argument; let us place it in different Lights, and try it in parallel Cases.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Let</strong> it then be affirmed, or if you will, supposed; first, that <em>Temperance and Exercise constitute a compleat Rule of Health</em>. Secondly, that <em>this Rule is evident to Mankind from Observation and Experience</em>. What follows? According to your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Argument, that <em>Physick and Physicians are altogether useless</em>. Can we imagine a more ridiculous Conclusion? And yet how, or wherein does it differ from his own?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Not to mention any hereditary Disadvantages; as Man is a Free-Agent, it is always in his power to impair the Health, and vitiate the Constitution, either of his Mind or his Body: and in both Cases Remedies are wanting, notwithstanding the Perfection of the forementioned Rules. Why then will not your Author allow Physicians for Mens Souls, as well as for their Bodies?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;According to our Saviour<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s own Declaration, He <em>came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance:</em> not to tend the <em>Whole</em>, but to administer to the <em>Sick</em>; who not only stand in need of Medicines, but require a very different Regimen from the other.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But has not <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">not [this] | this</span></span> this Author made Provision for the Distempers of Mens Minds? Has he not laid down <em>Repentance</em> as an absolute and efficacious Remedy in all Cases? Does he not hold that this Remedy was in every Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Reach; and by Consequence, that he needed no Physician but himself? So indeed he seems to say; and it must be his Meaning. But instead of proving these material Points, he has only begged them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;On the contrary, I maintain, and hope to find an Opportunity of making it good, that however this may be looked upon as a natural Remedy; yet the greatest Part of it is entirely supernatural: that alone, and of itself, it could not heal Men; though a necessary Preparative for their being healed. At present, I shall only take Notice, that though the Light of Nature might give Men just Hopes that Repentance would produce some good Effect; yet what that Effect would be, no Mortal was able to discover: and this I think proveable even from your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s own Principles.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If then, as I am now only supposing, this Remedy was doubtful, and defective, before Revelation; and Men could not tell what to expect from it; the Consequence is manifest. For how few are willing to take bitter Medicines, or undergo severe Operations; in expectation of a Cure, both imperfect, and very uncertain? And yet it is notorious, that the Generality of Mankind will do and suffer far more for the Health of their Bodies, than for that of their Minds. In the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [latter] | latter</span></span> latter Case, if the Encouragements be not very strong, and the Prospect very fair; the Patient is intractable and obstinate, and will yield to nothing.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> let us view the Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Argument in a different Position. Let us suppose Men to enjoy naturally all the Light that he allows them for the Direction of their Conduct: Might they not nevertheless go astray, and want to be reduced?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In clear Day-light, and open Sun-shine, may not a Traveller take a wrong Road; and wander on till he bewilder himself? Perhaps some amusing Object catches his Eye, and tempts him aside. Perhaps it detains him there; and so far engages his Mind, as to make him forget both his Road and his Journey. Is all Advice, all Assistance, in such a Case needless? Is it not, on the contrary, very desirable; that some Friend, wiser than himself, would providentially interpose to awaken and admonish him; or leading him gently by the Hand, bring him back into the Way from whence he erred? Should he moreover, to prevent the like Excursions for the future, assure him, that the Affair he is going about is of infinitely greater Consequence than he imagined; and that his Welfare entirely depends on his Diligence and Expedition: Should he press him with the greatest Earnestness to pursue his Journey vigorously, and without Deviation or Trifling; and to encourage him the more effectually, should he promise him his <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">his [Com-] | Company</span></span> Company and Assistance to the far-end; and undertake, if he were not wanting to himself, to carry him through all Difficulties that he might happen to meet with: would such Offices as these be useless; or such Offers contemptible?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If this Traveller should refuse the Aid of such a Friend, and reject his kind Proposals; if he should tell him, that he had Light enough upon his Hands, and that he knew his Road and his Business; and therefore was determined not to go back with him; but to take his own Time, and his own Measures: if he should farther declare, that he thought him too officious; and that he had no occasion either for his Help, or his Counsel; would not any one who knew the Case, conclude that Man doubly lost; and that he was out of his Wits, as well as out of his Way?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Whatever</strong> may be laid to the latter Part of this Case; the former is certainly applicable to all Mankind. They had all wandered from the Path of their Duty, and struck out in Pursuit of their own Inventions. What was then to be done? To bring them back by mere Compulsion was neither consistent with the Nature of Man, nor the Nature of Virtue: and to suffer them to perish without Relief, or further Trial, was equally repugnant to the Divine Wisdom and Goodness. According to your Author, there was no occasion for the Interposition of Heaven. Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Way was, plain before him; if he would not persist, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">persist, [when] | when</span></span> when he was in it; nor return, when he was out of it; let him look to the Consequence.---But what Absurdity in supposing, that God should be pleased to try some further Expedient for the Recovery of Mankind? That He should set before them stronger, and more certain Motives, than they ever knew, or could know, before? That He should strengthen their Obligations by new and unexpected Mercies? That He should favour them with a perfect Example, as well as a perfect Rule? That He should vouchsafe them such Aids and Influences; as might, consistently with Liberty and Virtue, facilitate their Conversion? If any Man can shew that such Means as these were either improper or superfluous; let him produce his Proofs.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It cannot, I think, be denied, but that whatever Methods appear most conducive to the Promotion of Virtue and Happiness; are, on that very Account, most likely to be chosen by the Supreme Being. And whoever considers the Christian Revelation attentively, and without Prejudice; will soon discover its Connexion with those great Ends.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That Men wanted a Deliverance from the <em>Penalty</em>, as well as the <em>Dominion</em> of Sin; seems to me most evident: but it is a Point that I meddle not with at this time. Neither have I yet insisted on the Defects of natural Reason; though it would greatly have strengthened some of the foregoing Observations. But as this, Sir, is the Subject of your <em>second Query</em>, which I had no mind to anti<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">anti- [cipate;] | cipate;</span></span>cipate; it was therefore omitted.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Here then you ask,

2. <em>WHETHER I can make any Doubt of</em> <strong>the Sufficiency of the Light of Nature</strong>? Which, it seems, appears to you so manifest a Truth; that whoever disputes it, must be, you think, <em>either very injudicious, or very partial</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;So general, and so ambiguous a Question, is not to be answered in the lump; but must be carefully unfolded, and taken to pieces. The first Thing to be inquired, is, what is meant by <em>the Light of Nature</em>. The <em>Light of Nature</em>, and the <em>Law of Nature</em>, are used promiscuously by your Author; nor can I find him ever making any Distinction between them. If then by the <em>Light of Nature</em>, you mean the <em>Law of Nature</em>, considered objectively, and in itself; I not only allow its <em>Sufficiency</em>, but its full <em>Perfection</em>. That Law which results from the Eternal Reasons and Relations of Things, must needs be a compleat Rule of Action for all <em>intelligent Creatures</em>; and I beg leave to add, even for the <em>Creator</em> Himself; who, I humbly suppose, neither is, nor can be, directed by any other. It seems utterly impossible to discover, or conceive, any other Foundation for the moral Perfection of the Deity, and the Rectitude of His Actions; than that of a Conformity to this sacred Law.<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> By Him it is clearly perceived <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">perceived [in] | in</span></span> in all its Branches, and in its utmost Comprehension: as by Him it is eternally and universally fulfilled.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;This then is the great Light which enlightens all moral Agents, and directs the whole intellectual System: but in Measures and Degrees infinitely various. This is that all-sufficient Rule which springs from the essential Agreement, Order, Proportion and Truth of Things; and which constitutes all Beauty, Goodness, Virtue and Perfection. This is that sacred and supreme Law, which the Divine Author of Christianity came to repromulge and make manifest to the Children of Men; as far as they were concerned in it. And I must take the Liberty to affirm, that we hereby not only see further into it; but much more plainly, clearly, and distinctly.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As some of the Lights of Heaven twinkle at an immense distance before our naked Eyes, but are magnified and brought near by a Telescope; such in a great measure, is the Appearance of Moral and Divine Truths to our unassisted Faculties, and to our Understandings enlightened by Revelation.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to proceed; properly speaking, the <em>Light of Nature</em> signifies that Share, that Por<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Por- [tion] | tion</span></span>tion of Moral Truth, which Men are naturally capable of discovering. Though the Sun be always the same in itself; yet the Light of it is variously enjoyed by Mankind; according to the Difference of their Sight, or Situation. And thus it is with Truth; which Men profess in a larger or less Degree, according to their Abilities, Opportunities, Application, Conduct. In both Cases, that only can be said to be any Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s natural Light; which he enjoys, or is capable of enjoying, by the Use of his natural Faculties.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Here</strong> then a Question arises, which I must by no means leave behind me. Your Author seems to lay great Stress on it: but why, or upon what Account, I am not able to determine. I shall put it as fairly and strongly as I can.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Has not God enabled all Mankind, even Those who never heard of Revelation, to obtain as much Light and Knowledge, as may be sufficient to direct them in the Discharge of their Duty?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;How I understand this Question, will appear immediately. In the mean time; without Scruple, or Hesitation, I answer in the Affirmative. Most certainly, in one Sense, this is the Case of every Man living. And the Reason is plain. It cannot possibly be any Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Duty</em> to <em>do</em>, what is not in his Power to <em>know</em>. Whoever improves his Knowledge as much as he can, and practises accordingly; is sure to discharge his Duty. In this sense, and in this respect, no Man wants <em>Light</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Light</em>. [<strong>But</strong>] | <strong>But</strong></span></span>
<strong>But</strong> what is this to the Purpose? How does it follow from hence, that the Lights of Revelation are useless, even in respect of Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Duty? I speak not here of its Means, or its Motives; nor of the beneficial Influence of its Doctrines; but merely of its practical Precepts. Notwithstanding the foregoing Concessions, it is very evident, that a certain <em>System of Truth</em>, a certain <em>Standard of Knowledge</em>, is requisite <em>for Instruction in Righteousness</em>; that Men <em>may be perfect, throughly [!!!] furnished unto all good Works</em>. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> no Man can be obliged to practise more than his Circumstances will permit him to know; which to him is, and must be, the Measure of his Duty: yet, doubtless, there is a <em>compleat Rule of Life</em>, an <em>adequate Scheme of Morality</em>; which, in general, is properly called <em>Human Duty</em>. And this I suppose to comprehend all the several Relations in which Men stand toward their Creator, their Fellow-Creatures, and Themselves.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Conduct of the most uncivilized <em>Indian</em>, the most ignorant <em>Barbarian</em>, may be approved, and the Man accepted: Is he therefore (not to mention Christians) in as good a Condition as <em>Antoninus</em> or <em>Socrates?</em> As reasonably may we suppose these upon a Level with <em>Angels</em>. The better Men understand their Duty, the more virtuous they may be; the more virtuous they are, the further they advance toward Perfection; the nearer they are to Perfection, the larger is their Sphere and Prospect of Happiness.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Sup<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Sup- [posing] | posing</span></span>posing then, for the present, that Revelation had no other Use, no other Effect, than promoting the Knowledge of Morality, and affording Mankind a perfect Scheme of Human Duty; the Benefit of it would undeniably be very great. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> therefore the <em>Light of Nature</em> be <em>sufficient</em> in one respect, it may be very <em>insufficient</em> in another.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<aside class="sidenote">
<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Page 277.</span>
</aside>
<strong>We</strong> may now go on to consider, Whether, according to the Idea of Human Duty, here laid down, Man be capable of fully discovering it by the mere Force of natural Reason? <em>Must we not be obliged to own</em>, says<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> your Author, <em>that Reason is as certain a Guide for Rational Creatures, as Instinct is for Irrational?</em> In one Sense this will be readily granted; and in another, as readily denied. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> <em>perfect Instinct</em> is a certain Guide for Irrational Creatures; yet is <em>imperfect Reason</em> a certain Guide for <em>Rational</em> ones? If the Question be otherwise put, the Case is misrepresented. <em>Right Reason</em> is, doubtless, a sure Guide for all intelligent Beings whatever. But considering <em>Reason</em> as a <em>Faculty</em> in Man; the Question is, How far it reaches, and what Light it affords?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>As</strong> Man came out of the Hands of his Maker, it is highly probable that he possessed those intellectual Abilities, that Share of Reason, which this Author seems to claim for the whole Species. What our first Parents <em>actually</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>actually</em> [<em>knew</em>,] | <em>knew</em>,</span></span> <em>knew</em>, I presume not to determine; nor is it material. What I suppose, and contend for, is, that they wanted not <em>Capacity</em> to discover every Relation, every Moral Truth, that concerned Human Nature. But if he, and you, Sir, will allow me to add, that this Nature was corrupted, first by Them, and afterwards by their Descendents; then the Question will be, How far Human Reason has either way suffered, and what Damage or Diminution it has sustained?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> have nothing to say to the absurd Doctrine of <em>Hereditary Guilt:</em> but, nevertheless, I maintain, that whatever wounds or weakens the <em>Root</em>, must naturally hurt the <em>Branches</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I look upon it as a plain, obvious Truth, that whatever strengthens and exalts the Passions, does, in Proportion, darken and depress the Understanding. As this is probable from the very Nature of Things, so Experience fully confirms it. Whenever Passion prevails over Reason, and governs instead of it, it produces <em>Natural</em> Disorder, as well as <em>Moral:</em> It not only throws a Cloud over the Mind for the Time present, but leaves a dark Shade behind it. Every vicious Action both debilitates the Agent, and stupifies [sic] the Understanding, in Proportion to the Nature and Degree of it. To <em>commit Sin</em>, is to enter into <em>Servitude</em>. Every After-Commission increases the Bondage; and is an actual Diminution both of Light and Liberty. I speak not of <em>natural Liberty</em>. The Man is as much <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">much [an] | an</span></span> an Agent after, as before: But his Appetites and Passions acquiring hereby fresh Weight, Strength, and Influence, bring the Agent under such Difficulties, as are, in effect, equivalent to a Decay of natural Liberty.

<strong>If</strong> then the Sin of our First Parents had this Effect upon <em>them</em>; what hinders us from concluding that it might also redound to the Disadvantage of their <em>Off-spring?</em> It is not, I think, to be doubted, but the Principles of our Nature were originally balanced with great Exactness. But if that Balance was destroyed, or weakened, in our first Parents; it is natural to suppose that the Mischief would be transmitted. If their Passions were, by the Fall, raised and strengthened beyond their original Pitch, a correspondent Effect might be produced, at least in their immediate Descendants; and, by Consequence, in the whole sinful Race.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let it be allowed, and maintained, that all Mens <em>Minds</em> are created pure and uncorrupt; they must, and will, very much depend on the State of those Bodies to which they are joined. Those <em>Bodies</em> may have inherited such Indispositions, as, by the Laws of Union, will naturally affect the Mind: Such as may communicate an undue Strength, a disproportioned Eagerness, to its Appetites and Passions; and, by Consequence, both darken the Understanding, and render the Choice of Virtue more difficult. In short, irregular Passions produce certain Effects, and Alterations, both in the Mind, and in the Body. Those <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Those [which] | which</span></span> which are produced in the Mind, terminate there, and cannot descend: those which are produced in the Body, may be propagated to Posterity, like any other corporeal Affection.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As there is nothing in this Account repugnant to Reason, so it is agreeable so plain Fact, and familiar Observation. How commonly do we hear it remarked, what a strong Tincture Men often take from the Inclinations and Passions of their immediate Parents, and that even in Cases where there has been no Possibility of deriving it from Education. If then this be allowed in respect of <em>immediate</em> Parents, nothing will oblige us to stop <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>till we come to the <em>First</em>. Whatever Principle accounts for such particular Derivations, will also account for the general Doctrine which I have been considering.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That remarkable Strength and Prevalence of Passion, which has been so often observed, and is indeed so observable every-where, in all Countries, in all Ages, in every Stage of Life, not excepting even Infancy, seems greatly to confirm this derivative Corruption; as likewise to point out, wherein that Corruption more particularly consists.

<strong>And</strong> when to this is added an irregular and dissolute Education, perverting the Mind With ill Principles, and immoral Examples, and sowing those Seeds of Vice and Profaneness, which have shot up into such rank Impiety, and produced all over the World such <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">such [a foul] | a foul</span></span> a foul and formidable Harvest; can we wonder at the Decay of the Light of Nature, or the general Increase of Ignorance? Is it not natural to expect, amidst such Disorders, and such a Dissolution of Mariners, that Mens Faculties should grow dull, and their Perceptions dim? that Knowledge should be obstructed, and Truth obscured? in a word, that a thick Mist should universally prevail, and cover the Minds of Men? Ignorance and Vice mutually produce and promote each other. Unruly Lusts and Passions do as naturally darken the Understanding, as Clouds and Vapours blacken the Air, and blot the Face of Day.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And, indeed, it must be confessed, whatever Disadvantages Men may be supposed to <em>inherit</em>, that their Understandings are much more damaged by their own proper Vices, and <em>personal</em> Corruptions, than by any thing they are capable of deriving either from their nearest or remotest Parents. Whatever Effect Sin produces on the Appetites and Passions, it must naturally be strongest at the first-hand, unless other Causes intervene to hinder it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What makes the Matter still worse, is, that Vice and Immorality are not only Enemies to Light and Truth; but recommend Ignorance, and render Men <em>Lovers of Darkness</em>. Hereby it becomes not only tolerable, but eligible; as it hides them from themselves, and hinders them from perceiving the Wretchedness of their Condition.

<strong>But</strong> though the <em>Light of Nature</em> was thus doubly impaired, I readily grant that it was by no means extinguished. The chief Lines of Duty, the <em>Magna Moralia</em>, ever remained visible to all Men, unless when they wilfully shut their Eyes. It was not in the Power of the most corrupt Part of Mankind to bring themselves to an utter Insensibility of all moral Obligations. No Depravation could have such an Effect as this, nor any thing less than a total Loss of Understanding.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The most ignorant and uninstructed Heathen must have had some Ideas of Justice, Probity, Gratitude, Mercy, and the like. And I grant you, Sir, that even this little <em>Light of Nature</em> was, in some Sense, <em>sufficient</em> for him. If we suppose him to have improved it as far as he was able, and to have practised accordingly, he could not fail of being approved in the Sight of God: But, in another Sense, it was manifestly <em>insufficient</em>; I mean, for bringing Mankind to that <em>Standard of Duty</em> which belongs to their Nature, and that <em>State of Perfection</em> whereof they are capable. If it could be shewn that <em>the Light of Nature</em>, either at its lowest Ebb, or highest Flow, was capable of carrying Men this Length; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> I could not even then allow Revelation to be needless; yet I should acknowledge it less needful, less expedient, than I can do at present.

And indeed, for the most part, they did not regard themselves; but taught one way, and lived another. Whatever therefore they knew, they were not likely to have much Success; or to promote, in any considerable Degree, the Interests of Truth and Virtue.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But I further deny that any of them were compleatly qualified, even in respect of Knowledge; As far as I can perceive, not one of them came up to the fore-mentioned <em>Standard</em>; not one of them was Master of an <em>adequate, perfect Rule of Life</em>; not one of them has given us Grounds to conclude, that he had a clear Perception of that entire <em>System of Relations</em>, or <em>Moral Truths</em>, which constitute human Duty; not <em>Aristotle</em>, not <em>Plato</em>, not <em>Socrates</em> himself&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Were <em>Cicero</em> now living, and was to draw up (as he would be very likely to do) a Scheme of human Duty out of the New Testament; putting it in his own Method, and dressing it his own way; how would such a Work appear, in comparison with his <em>Offices?</em> As much superior, I doubt not, in every unprejudiced Eye, as his <em>Offices</em> are to School-Boys Themes, or the Prattle of Children.

What ever it be, or be called, you may find it every-where adorning our sacred Pages, and shining through the Gospel in its full Majesty and Lustre. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it was scarce mentioned or thought of before, yet how immediately did it recommend itself to the Understandings of Mankind?

Whatever may be determined concerning the <em>Stile</em> of the Evangelical Writers, which is a Point of no great Moment; every Attempt that is made to depreciate the Gospel <em>Morals</em>, must recoil in an Instant, and fall directly either upon the Understanding, or the Integrity of the Undertaker.

<strong>I</strong> might go on to observe, how <em>insufficient</em> the mere <em>Light of Nature</em> was to give Mankind such worthy Notions of the Deity, as are made known by Revelation. It is not, indeed, likely, that they, who could not arrive at an adequate Idea of Human Perfection, should be able to frame just Apprehensions of the Divine. But allowing their Discoveries on this Subject to be considerable; still those Discoveries, whatever they might be, were, in a great measure, locked up among a few Philosophers: The Generality of Mankind knew little or nothing of them. I mention not those vile Opinions, and impious Conceptions, which prevailed among the Heathens far and wide. They might, and therefore ought to have known better: Though even in this respect the Benefit of Revelation was very great. But let the wisest of them be examined, and it will appear, that what they taught concerning the Deity, did not come up to those Ideas which are familiar to almost all Christians.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As to the <em>Certainty of a Future State</em>, and the <em>Immortality of the Soul</em>, I shall need to say little: It has been often shewn, how darkly and dubiously the Heathens judged concerning these weighty <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">weighty [Points:] | Points:</span></span> Points: That the Hopes of the most Knowing, and most Considerate, were but faint, obscure, and wavering.

<strong>We</strong> are now apt to think that the fore-mentioned Doctrines are even demonstrable by Reason. And, perhaps, so they are: But by what Reason? I answer, By that Reason which is exercised, improved, and enlightened by Revelation. The more I consider, the more I am convinced, that many Arguments, many Truths, both Moral and Religious, which appear to us the Products of our Understandings, and the Fruits of Ratiocination, are, in reality, nothing more than Emanations from Scripture, Rays of the Gospel imperceptibly transmitted, and, as it were, conveyed to our Minds in a Side-Light: That many of our Deductions and Discoveries, which we are apt to look upon as the Oracles of our Reason, would be found, if they were fairly traced, entirely owing to certain Hints borrowed from Revelation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Had any Man, two thousand Years ago, <em>delineated the Religion of Nature</em>, or <em>demonstrated the Attributes of God</em>, in such a manner as we have lately seen both done; we might then have justly entertained a high Opinion of the Light of Nature, and the Strength and Compass of human Understanding. No Man can say, that the Learned of those Times wanted Genius.

It is easy to perceive several Truths, and sometimes Half-Truths, derived from thence, whether they knew it, or not; several Beams of Divine Light scattered here and there, illuminating their Works, and often-times breaking out amidst Error and Rubbish.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Pardon me, Sir, if I think and speak somewhat freely upon this Occasion: Even the <em>Virtuosi</em> of your Sect are this way indebted to those inspired Writings which they disown and reject. The Gospel has enlightened even <em>Them</em>, however insensible they may be of the Favour. I shall take the Liberty to affirm, that the best Part of that Knowledge which they ascribe to the Light of Nature, is really supernatural; and, perhaps, it may be said, that they fight Christianity with its own Weapons.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But I believe you think it high time that I should proceed to your next Query, which runs in these Words:

<div class="indented numbered">
3. <em><strong>Has</strong> not the Author, in his last Chapter, plainly proved Dr.</em> <strong>Clarke</strong> <em>inconsistent with himself; and that one Part of his Lectures clashes with another?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In my Opinion, the chief Thing which the Author has proved in that Chapter, is, that he has grosly misunderstood Dr. <em>Clarke</em>, and betrayed the Confusion of his own Ideas. But let us fairly examine this Point, that it may appear, whether the Subject before us be an Inconsistency <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Inconsistency [of] | of</span></span> of Dr. <em>Clarke</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s, or a Blunder of your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In setting forth the Obligations of Morality, Dr. <em>Clarke</em> every-where speaks of the <em>Law of Nature</em> in the highest and most advantageous Terms. He considers it as arising necessarily and invariably from the true <em>Natures</em>, <em>Reasons</em>, and <em>Relations of Things</em>. He represents it as a System of <em>eternal</em>, <em>universal</em>, and <em>unchangeable</em> Truths; as a perfect Rule of Action; as a <em>Law independent of</em> and <em>antecedent to</em>, all other <em>Laws</em> and <em>Obligations</em> whatever. He declares, that <em>all Rational Creatures are obliged to govern themselves, in all their Actions, by the eternal Rule of Reason; and that it is not only a Law to Creatures, but to God himself, who is pleased to make it the unalterable Rule of his Actions in the Government of the World</em>. These, and many other Declarations of the like Nature, are made by Dr. <em>Clarke</em>; and some of them are quoted at large by your Author in the fore-mentioned Chapter.

<strong>Has</strong> then Dr. <em>Clarke</em> advanced any thing afterwards in Contradiction hereto? Has he anywhere denied the Truth or Perfection of this sacred Rule? Has he, in any Part of his Book, expressed himself in Derogation from it, or Diminution of it? Not one Syllable can I find to any such Purpose.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What then has he done? Why, he has brought a Charge against Mankind, of Ignorance, Negligence, Perverseness, Stupidity. He has affirmed, that they are such weak, frail, corrupt Creatures, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Creatures, [that] | that</span></span> that sometimes they cannot, and, very often, will not understand, of themselves, what belongs to their Duty. He has represented Men, even the wisest of them, as invincibly ignorant, without Revelation, of some Points of the utmost Consequence. And as to the Generality, he has shewn, that they stand in Need, upon many Accounts, of more Light, and better Instruction, than either their own Reason, or that of the ablest Philosophers, could ever afford them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whether these be Facts, or Mistakes, I desire to know where lies the <em>Inconsistency?</em> On the one hand, we find, = excellent Truths; a compleat Rule; a most divine Law: = On the other hand, = Men corrupt; Faculties neglected; Understandings depraved. = I have brought these Doctrines close together, to give you, Sir, a fairer Opportunity of discovering that Opposition which your Author pretends to find between them. But who can find it besides himself? Will any Man say, that the Reality, or Perfection of a Rule, depends upon the Skill or Disposition of the Agent? Can the eternal Truth and Reason of Things be disannulled, or any way altered, by the Ignorance or Frowardness of Mankind? Why then so much Pains taken to bring in Dr. <em>Clarke</em> as an Evidence against himself? Why so many Passages produced, in order to prove that he had often said, what, indeed, he always said, and never once denied?

<strong>But</strong> has not Dr. <em>Clarke</em> acknowledged likewise, that those moral Truths which constitute the <em>Law of Nature</em>, are undeniable and irresistible? Has he not declared, in Bishop <em>Cumberland</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Words, that <em>the Reason of all Men everywhere, as naturally and necessarily assents to them, as all Animals conspire in the Pulse and Motion of their Heart and Arteries; or as all Men agree in their Judgment concerning the Whiteness of Snow, or the Brightness of the Sun?</em> Very true: But what follows? Why, your Author tells<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> us, if we will but <em>have Patience</em>, we <em>shall see</em>, that <em>Snow is no longer white, or the Sun bright</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But when, or where shall we see this strange Promise made good? I have patiently waited, and searched quite through his Book, and yet can find nothing like it. What ever Dr. <em>Clarke</em> may have said of Mens <em>Faculties</em>, or the Abuse of those Faculties; yet, in all his Writings, the great <em>Object</em> we are speaking of, ever retains its full <em>Brightness</em>. Not one <em>Spot</em> does he ever find in this <em>intellectual Sun</em>. If your Author is of a different Opinion, I desire him to favour us with a single Instance.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But if the <em>Law of Nature be naturally and necessarily assented to by the Reason of all Men</em>; how is this consistent with that Ignorance and Darkness, which, according to Dr. <em>Clarke</em>, prevailed so much in the World?

If I should say, that all <em>Geometrical</em> Truths <em>are naturally and necessarily assented to by the Reason of all Men</em>; few, I am persuaded, would object to the Proposition. And yet <em>Morality</em>, however neglected, was always more generally known and considered than <em>Geometry</em>. Whoever has a real Perception of any Truth, must unavoidably assent to it as such: but if he had never examined it, never taken it into his Thoughts; however clear and evident it might be in itself, it would be to him as nothing.

<strong>Your</strong> Author asks,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> and a strange Question it is, <em>Can the Law of Nature be clear, and the Light of Nature dim?</em> Now he often declares, that by the <em>Law of Nature</em>, he means the <em>eternal Truth</em>, <em>Relations</em>, and <em>Reasons of Things</em>. Have these then any Dependance on the <em>Faculties</em> of Men, whether corrupt, or uncorrupt? Can <em>Light</em> and <em>Truth</em> be any way affected by bad <em>Eyes</em>, and weak <em>Understandings?</em> So he seems to think, by what follows: For he tells us in the next Words, that the <em>Law of Nature is nothing but what the Light of Nature or Reason dictates</em>. And his Meaning must be, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> in direct Contradiction to himself, that the <em>Law of Nature</em> is, whatever any Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Reason, or <em>Faculty of Understanding</em>, suggests to him. What a Foundation is here for a perfect <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">perfect [immu-] | immutable,</span></span> immutable, eternal Law! For, pray, Sir, is not every Man living confessedly fallible? And are not most Mens Understandings exceedingly erroneous? Judge, I beseech you, how far this Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Light of Nature</em> is to be trusted; and whether it ought to be looked upon as a safer Guide than the <em>Gospel</em>. Sometimes the <em>Law of Nature</em> is a System of eternal Truths; and sometimes, the poor Opinions, and precarious Perceptions of weak Men: that is, <em>the Snow is sometimes white</em>, and <em>the Sun bright</em>, and sometimes neither; as the Author undertook to shew us.---But let us hear Dr. <em>Clarke</em> himself concerning this Matter, who tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he be <em>dead, yet speaketh</em>; and, if I mistake not, will continue to <em>speak</em>, as long as our Language shall last: <em>What</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>the Relations, Fitnesses or Unfitnesses of Things, absolutely and necessarily are in themselves; that also they appear to be to the Understandings. of all intelligent Beings</em>; (thus far I suppose your Author read, and then stopped; but I must go on) <em>except those only, who understand Things to be what they are not; that is, whose Understandings are either very imperfect, or very much depraved</em>. By <em>imperfect Understandings</em>, the <em>Relations of Things</em> may be sometimes misperceived, sometimes not perceived at all. How much more frequently may either of these Inconveniences happen to such Understandings, as are not only <em>imperfect</em>, but <em>very imperfect</em>, and <em>very much depraved?</em>

<strong>But</strong> to return: As Men must necessarily assent to the Truths and Obligations of Morality, when really perceived; so Dr. <em>Clarke</em> has owned, and every-where maintained, that the principal of those Truths are actually perceived by all Men, excepting those who wilfully shut their Eyes and Understandings; which, indeed, is, and ever has been, too often the Case, as he himself observes and complains.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;As no Man, by the Force of mere natural Reason, was able to discover the entire System of moral Relations, or every Truth which concerned human Duty; so even the <em>main Branches of Morality</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> spread over <em>all Nations</em>, as the Doctor acknowledges,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> might, thro<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> Men<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Negligence, and other the like Causes, find very little Place in the Minds of the Generality. But let us attend once more to his own Explanation: <em>Not</em>, says he,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>that God has any where left himself wholly without Witness; or that the Difference of Good and Evil is, to any Rational Being, undiscernible; but through supine Negligence, and want of Attention, Men let their Reason, as it were, sleep, and are deaf to the Dictates of common Understanding</em>. You see, Sir, here plainly, in respect of the <em>Magna Moralia</em>, the <em>main Branches of Morality</em>; what sort of Ignorance it is that Dr. <em>Clarke</em> complains of. Not the Obscurity of such Truths, but the Stupidity of Men; not the Impotence of their Understandings, but the Perverseness <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Perverseness [of] | of</span></span> of their Wills.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Clear Day-light is, in itself, always the same; but all Men do not equally enjoy it; and upon some it is quite lost. Suppose a Man to have blinded himself by Intemperance, and Debauchery; he is forced to <em>grope about at Noon-day</em>, and the clearest Light is Darkness to him. Is not the Eye of the Mind capable of Abuse, as well as those of the Body? Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> Truth itself can never fail, or be diminished; yet may not Mens Understandings be dimmed, or depraved, to any Degree? Or, to bring the Resemblance nearer, Light and Truth are visible to all Men who have Sight and Understanding; but they may perceive neither, if they chuse to wink, or fall asleep.

<strong>Having</strong> thus seen, as far as was needful, what it is that Dr. <em>Clarke</em> has <em>said</em>; let us inquire a little further, what it is that he has <em>unsaid</em>, according to the Charge which your Author brings against him. Of the former, the Substance is, a high Character given of the Moral Law, and some Concessions in Favour of Human Understanding. Let us hear what it is, that your Author calls the Doctor<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>new Scheme:</em> It consists, he says,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> in supposing, <em>that tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> in the original uncorrupted State of human Nature, Right Reason may justly be supposed to have been a sufficient Guide, and a principle powerful enough to have preserved Men in the constant Practice of their Duty; yet, upon the Fall, Mankind were in a very bad State, as</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>as</em> [<em>wanting</em>] | <em>wanting</em></span></span> <em>wanting greater Help and Assistance than the Light of Nature could afford them: And that there was plainly wanting some extraordinary and supernatural Assistance, above the Reach of bare Reason and Philosophy, to recover Mankind out of their universally degenerate State, into a State suitable to the original Dignity of their Nature</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Now, whether these Assertions be true or false, was it not incumbent on this Author, considering what he had promised, to shew their Inconsistency with the foregoing Doctrines? Would not every Reader naturally expect it? But this is so far from being done, that I cannot find your Author so much as attempting it. And, indeed, if he had attempted it, he must unavoidably have lost his Labour.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;For may not Men be very <em>imperfect</em>, and in a <em>very bad State</em>, notwithstanding the <em>Perfection of the Law of Nature?</em> And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> <em>the Difference of Good and Evil be naturally discernible</em>, and <em>the main Branches of Morality</em> plain and obvious; yet might not <em>supernatural Help and Assistance be much wanted?</em> If Mens Minds were not only <em>imperfect</em>, but much <em>depraved</em>; of some moral Truths they might have no Knowledge at all; of others a very defective one. They might likewise be very unmindful and regardless of what they did know; and even doze themselves in a spiritual Lethargy, not removeable by natural Methods. If not only their Understandings were depraved, but also their Manners very corrupt, they might want <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">want [many] | many</span></span> many <em>supernatural Helps</em>. The Means of Pardon, Reconciliation, Grace; stronger Motives, and more certain Encouragements, to <em>cease to do Evil</em>, and <em>learn to do well</em>; suitable Influences from above: in a word, a vigorous Application to their Hopes and Fears; and an awakening Prospect into another World.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;These Doctrines therefore of Dr. <em>Clarke</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s are so far from being contradictory, or repugnant to each other, that they do not in the least interfere.

<strong>But</strong> tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> your Author has not proved, nor could prove, these latter Assertions <em>inconsistent</em> with the former; yet he had a mind to try, it seems, whether he could not disprove the Truth of them. Let us then go so far out of our way, as to hear what he objects, and how he reasons. <em>This is supposing</em>, says he,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>that God had left all Mankind for</em> 4000 <em>Years together, and even the greatest Part to this Day, destitute of sufficient Means to do their Duty, and to preserve themselves from sinking into a corrupt and degenerate State; and that it was impossible for them when thus sunk, to recover themselves; and yet that God (their Duty being the same after, as before the Fall) expected Impossibilities from them,</em> viz<em>. either to preserve themselves from thus falling; or, if fallen, to recover themselves</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Does this Author imagine, that all Mankind, during the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [long] | long</span></span> long Term he speaks of, were left wholly to the Guidance of their own Reason, and the Glimmerings of the Light of Nature? Not to mention the Case of the <em>Jews</em>, were there not Footsteps, or rather Tracks of Revelation, in most Places, thro<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> that whole Period? To make Allowance for this, would perhaps have damaged the Sound of his Argument; and therefore he omitted it. However, let us take him in his own way.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That Dr. <em>Clarke supposed</em> no such Things as are here told us, this Author knew very well: and that his Words above-cited suppose no such Things, is my Business to shew. But in truth they sufficiently clear themselves, even at first sight. Does it follow, from Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s being in <em>a bad State</em>; that his Case is quite remediless, and desperate? Does it follow, from his want of more <em>Light</em>, and better <em>Helps</em>; that he is no longer an <em>Agent</em>, but a <em>mere Machine?</em> Does it follow, from his Inability to rise up to <em>the original Dignity of his Nature</em>; that he might be forced to sit still, and despond? And from which of the Premises does it follow; that <em>God expected Impossibilities from him?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;This Author should have remembered the Title of his own Book. If <em>Christianity</em> be <em>as old as the Creation</em>; how comes he to suppose all the Benefits of it confined to the latter Ages? Though after the Fall, it was not in the Power of Mankind to recover that State of Purity, and Perfection, from which they fell; yet <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">yet [they] | they</span></span> they never wanted <em>sufficient Means</em> for <em>doing</em> what was then become <em>their Duty</em>; in the Sense before explained. If following the best Light they could get; they acted conformably to it, and <em>did well: should they not be accepted?</em> But <em>Acceptance</em> is one thing, and <em>Perfection</em> another. <em>The Judge of all the Earth</em> would certainly <em>do right</em>. He would not therefore <em>expect Impossibilities</em>. Before the Fall, He expected, as well he might, that Man would continue innocent and perfect: after the Fall, He expected sincere and careful Endeavours, in respect of Knowledge and Practice: and for unavoidable Deficiencies, had decreed, and promised, to make suitable Provision, in due time. In the mean while, what Was in their Power; That He required, and no more.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;From the Impotence of fallen Man, the Author goes on to infer; that <em>a State of Degeneracy and Corruption must be the State which God designed he should be in; and that it would seem not only in vain, but a Crime in him to endeavour to change it</em>. A bold Conclusion; but a very weak one. God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s original Design was Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Innocence and Perfection. His subsequent Design was, that fallen Man should endeavour to come back, as near as he could, to his first State; and rely on his Promise for a Redeemer to come. Let your Author shew, if he can, that what he calls <em>the Doctor<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s new Scheme</em>, infers, or supposes any thing more than this. But let him not give us Amusements, instead of Arguments.

<strong>Give</strong> me Leave, Sir, to proceed a little further in my Search, that we may see whether your Author has succeeded better in some other Passages, produced by him in support of his main Charge. That which follows seems to be cited<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> by him with Indignation. <em>Even those few extraordinary Men of the Philosophers, who did sincerely endeavour to reform Mankind; were themselves entirely ignorant of some Doctrines, absolutely necessary for bringing about this great End of the Reformation and Recovery of Mankind.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Their whole Attempt to discover the Truth of Things, and to instruct others therein, was like wandering in the wide Sea; without knowing whither to go, or which way to take, or having any Guide to conduct them</em>. This Observation, your Author tells us, was made partly <em>to shew, that the Fault was not in the Creatures, but in the Creator</em>. And not content with this horrid Imputation; he peremptorily affirms afterwards, that according to Dr. <em>Clarke</em>, <em>the Fault</em> must be <em>in the eternal, universal, and unchangeable Law of Nature</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Here then the Doctor is directly attacked; but with no other Weapons, than bare groundless Assertions. The Accuser has shewn himself sufficiently forward; but his Evidence lags: as indeed well it may. Whatever Defects the Doctor might observe in the fore-mentioned <em>Philosophers</em>; I am certain he <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">he [neither] | neither</span></span> neither would, nor could, find any <em>Fault</em> with the <em>Law of Nature</em>. When your Author produces the least Shadow of a Proof to the contrary, it shall be considered. And I am equally certain, that so wise, so good, so excellent a Man, would never <em>charge God foolishly</em>. He had juster Ideas of the Divine Majesty, and humbler Sentiments of Human Nature; than to imagine that Men had any Right, any Pretence, to be their own Carvers. He knew perfectly well, that the <em>Philosophers</em> had no more Reason to repine at the Imperfections of Human Nature; than <em>Peasants</em> have to grumble that they are not made Philosophers. Whatever Doctrines those Philosophers were ignorant of; <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>tis enough to silence all Objections, that no more was <em>required</em> either of them, or the Bulk of Mankind; than according to what was given.

<strong>If</strong> any <em>Philosopher</em> happened to <em>wander</em> never so widely, or to be even quite lost; could the Rules of Morality, <em>the Reasons and Relations of Things</em>, be lost with him? What ever Accidents or Misfortunes he might meet with in the <em>wide Sea</em>; could Truth, <em>eternal Truth</em>, be either sunk or ship-wrecked? To speak plainly; The Law of Nature, for that very Reason, because it is unchangeable, neither has, nor can have, any Dependance on human Understandings.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But why should it seem strange, that Men should <em>wander in the wide Sea</em>, without Revelation; when we find <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">find [they] | they</span></span> they still wander there, even with it? Is it not much stranger, that in these Days, Men should fail without the <em>Compass</em>; and ventrue, [!!!] at the same time, to be every Man his own <em>Pilot?</em> None of the antient Philosophers could wander more widely, more wilfully, more desperately, than this very Author; who despising the Lights of Heaven, trusts all to his own Arm, and his own Rudder: and that upon a very unsound, and infirm Bottom.

<strong>Your</strong> Author is so cautious, that he <em>dare not say there is the least Difference between the Law of Nature, and the Gospel; for that would suppose</em>, he tells<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> us, <em>some Defect in one of them, and reflect on the Author of both</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But he need not be under any such Apprehensions. For it would not suppose a Defect in either of them. It supposes indeed a Defect somewhere; and let every Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Conscience tell him where. The <em>Law of Nature</em> always was, and always will be, a compleat Rule of Action for Mankind; considered as Rational Beings, and Moral Agents. But Provision was, on many Accounts, wanting for Transgressors and Sinners. The whole Species was tainted, and every Individual guilty, in some Degree or other. In this common Exigence, this universal Distress; does it any way <em>reflect on the Author</em> of the Gospel, to suppose him, among other Reliefs, opening Mens Minds, enlightening their Understandings, and preparing them for the Reception of their eternal Duty? If they had, in some measure, lost sight of the <em>Law of Nature</em>; could it be amiss to set it before them in such a Light as was most agreeable to their Condition? Or even to add such Precepts, as might conduce to <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">to [their] | their</span></span> their Recovery, and Growth in Virtue?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;This then is so far from amounting to any <em>Reflection</em> on <em>the Author</em> of the Gospel; that it is a clear Proof, and a signal Instance, both of his Wisdom and Goodness. And it is so far from arguing any <em>Defect</em>, either in <em>the Law</em>, or <em>the Gospel</em>, that it rather argues the Perfection of both. For had not the Law been perfect; Men would not have been so incapable of coming up to it, without supernatural Assistance. Their falling so much short of it, is equally a Proof of their own Defects, and the Fullness of the Law. And as to the Gospel; it could not be less perfect than the Law, because it took it entirely in; and, at the same time, superadded such Rules, as were suitable to the Wants and Infirmities of Mankind. If it was not, in itself, more perfect than the Law; it was better adapted to their Circumstances, and the Disadvantages of their sinful State.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In vain then does your Author insist on the Perfection and Immutability of the <em>Law of Nature</em>. The Rules which <em>Christianity</em> has annexed; neither diminish it, nor alter it: on the contrary, they help Men to fulfil it; and are a wise Provision for human Frailty. The Law is ever the same; and had Men been so too, they would neither have needed Redemption, nor Revelation.

<strong>But</strong> to proceed; <em>Is it not strange</em>, says your Author, <em>to see so judicious a Divine write after such a manner; as if he thought, the best</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>best</em> [<em>way</em>] | <em>way</em></span></span> <em>way to support the Dignity of Revelation, was so derogate from the immutable and eternal Law of Nature?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And is it not strange, say I, that so acute an Author should confound the most distinct Ideas; and when, by so doing, he has run himself into an Absurdity; place it to Dr. <em>Clarke</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Account? When an illiterate Man laments his Ignorance; does he <em>derogate</em> from Learning? When I complain of the Weakness of my Sight; do I derogate from Sunshine? When Dr. <em>Clarke</em> affirms that Mens intellectual Powers were impaired; does he derogate from eternal Truths?
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Soon</strong> after, Dr. <em>Clarke</em> is accused of <em>asserting that in the Law of Nature there are undeniable Defects</em>; <em>and yet owning that God governs all his own Actions by it</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In justice to Dr. <em>Clarke</em>, I must call upon this Author, either to make good this Charge, or to retract it. Has the Doctor any where said, that God governs his Actions by the Light of our imperfect Ideas? No; but he has asserted that <em>God governs his Actions</em> by the eternal Truth and Reason of Things; that sacred Rule which directs, or ought to direct, the Actions of all intelligent Beings. Here then there can be no <em>Defects</em>; nothing being more evident than that the Rule which is observed by the Deity, must be perfect. Nor is it possible to imagine that Dr. <em>Clarke</em> should ever maintain the contrary. He has indeed asserted, that there are <em>undeniable Defects in the Light of Nature:</em> but this <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">this [is] | is</span></span> is so far from being fit to govern the Divine Actions, that it is not sufficient to govern our own.

<strong>But</strong> why does the Doctor <em>extol Revelation for those very Things it borrows from that Law?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Borrowing</em> does he call it; and <em>from</em> the Law? If it must be called borrowing, the whole is borrowed. But why such diminishing Expressions, and contemptuous Insinuations? Will any Man presume to question God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Right to his own eternal Truths? His they are, and must be; however they are made known to Mankind. Whether we find them written in our Hearts, or in the Books of Inspiration; the Truths are the same, and the Law-giver the same. They essentially constitute both the Natural, and Evangelical Law.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Should any Man say that St. <em>Paul</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Church</em> had <em>borrowed from</em> the <em>Fabrick</em> its <em>Foundations</em>, its <em>Walls</em>, its <em>Pillars</em>, its <em>Arches</em>, &<em>c</em>. what should we think of such an Observation? But should he go on to affirm, that the Structure was either weakened, or blemished, by the <em>Communion-Table</em>, and the <em>Font:</em> we might then conclude his Remarks certainly <em>borrowed</em> from your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Light of Nature</em>. I shall only add, that whatever the <em>Gospel</em> may have <em>borrowed from the Law</em>; there are some Things which this Author would do well to <em>borrow</em> from either <em>Law</em> or <em>Gospel</em>.

4. <em>Is it not a Libel on the Dignity of Human Nature, and a high Reflection on the Wisdom and Goodness of its Author; to represent All, but one Pair, in a corupt [sic], degenerate States?</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If the Charge be groundless; let it be <em>a Libel:</em> but if it be Fact; is it not a Libel on Truth itself, to call it so? Setting aside the Assurances of Revelation, have not the best and wisest Men in all Ages confessed and lamented the universal Corruption of Mankind? The Weakness of their Understandings, and the Pravity of their Wills? Are all Histories <em>Libels on human Nature?</em> They all attest this melancholy Truth, and confute your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Pretence. Their best Descriptions are allayed; and their fairest Characters shaded. Not to mention the vile and vicious Part of Mankind, whose Corruptions are confessed; let us view the rest. Nay, let us pick out the Flowers of our Species; the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [illustrious] | illustrious</span></span> illustrious Few, who distinguish themselves, and dignify human Nature. Have not even These their Imperfections and Infirmities, their Faults and their Follies? Is not their Knowledge a Mixture of Light and Darkness; and their Conduct a Composition of Wisdom and Weakness, Good and Evil? <em>In many Things</em> have they <em>all offended</em>; through Negligence very frequently; and sometimes in Disobedience to the Dictates of their own Minds. If they themselves are to be appealed to in this Matter, the Question is decided: for they are ever remarkably conscious of their own Defects, and ready to acknowledge them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> how is such a Representation of Human Nature, <em>a high Reflection on the Wisdom and Goodness of its Author?</em> Is it affirmed, that God required any Man to <em>do</em> more than he could <em>know?</em> or to <em>know</em> any Thing beyond his <em>Capacity?</em> Whatever Portion of Light and Knowledge Man possessed, or had in his Power, fallen or unfallen, it was his Business and his Duty to make a proper Use of it, and to walk by it honestly and uprightly. As far as he did this, his Conduct would be approved both by God and Man. Even in that dark and degenerate State which we are speaking of, Man was not wholly destitute of Light; Many Things he still, knew, and might have known many more. And what he knew, that he might practise, if he would; for he was still an Agent. Some kind of Power <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Power [he] | he</span></span> he must have to <em>do well</em>; for otherwise he could not have <em>done ill</em>. If he found himself exposed to many and great Temptations, this might occasion Difficulties and Conflicts; but it could extend no further: It could not turn an Agent into a Patient; could not bring him under a Necessity of Sinning; for that is a Contradiction. Had there been no Choice, there could not have been either Vice or Virtue. There might have been an Obliquity in his Actions; but that Obliquity would have been, not Moral, but Natural; not his Crime, but his Misfortune.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever he <em>might</em> do; without question he <em>would</em> often fail, and fall short. But what follows from hence? Nothing more, than the great Need Men had of those divine Assistances, about which we are contending. The weaker and more ignorant they were, the more they wanted fresh Light, and supernatural Aid.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> if degenerate Man, instead of acting and endeavouring according to his Power, should repine at his Lot, and murmur against Providence; how would he answer it?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Should he refuse to cultivate his Understanding, because he found Weeds in it: Should he suffer his Appetites and Passions to run wild, because he could not keep them in exact Order: Should he sow no Seed, because the Soil did not please him; and plant no Virtues, because they would not grow fast enough: Should he let all his Faculties wither, because <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">because [he] | he</span></span> he could not bring them to Perfection; and his Mind become a mere <em>Wilderness</em>, because he found himself dispossessed of <em>the Garden of Eden:</em> what Account would he be able to give of such Husbandry? Would it be <em>a high Reflection</em> on his Lord, or himself?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short, such Objections as these are themselves <em>Libels on human Nature</em>, and Proofs of that very <em>Degeneracy</em> which they are meant to disprove. If Men sunk themselves far below the Perfection of Angels, and even that of their own original State; surely it does not follow, that they must continue sinking further and further, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>till they arrive at a State of Brutality. While Man had any Features left of his Maker<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Image, he had just Cause to be thankful, and none to complain, unless of his own Folly and Ingratitude.

<strong>Your</strong> Author, it seems, can find no<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Difference, in relation to the Goodness of God, between Mens being created in a State of Corruption</em>, and permitted <em>to fall unavoidably into it</em>, For that, I suppose, is what he means. To say, as he expresses himself, that <em>God caused them to fall into it by the Folly of Adam</em>; is to say, what is not fit to be either answered, or repeated. Supposing then his Meaning to be what I have represented it; how comes it to pass, that he should over look so manifest, so obvious a Difference?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Difference?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; [Reason] | Reason</span></span> Reason assures us, that whatever comes immediately out of the Hands of the Creator, must be perfect in its Kind. It is evidently inconsistent with the Rectitude of the Divine Nature, to create any Being corrupt. That the Works of an infinitely perfect Agent would be defective in this Sense; is a Supposition that implies Repugnance and Incongruity between Cause and Effect. As all Creatures are finite, they must, indeed, be so far imperfect; and the lower any of them are placed in the Scale of Beings, the greater must their imperfection be: But it can never consist with the Perfection of the Creator, to produce what is blemished, and what falls below the Idea of its Kind.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Can</strong> then your Author shew the same Absurdity, in supposing that God should permit his Creatures to degenerate? In no sense, in no respect, could the Deity be answerable for the Sin of our First Parents. He <em>foresaw</em> it, indeed, as the Author observes: But what then? Was it reasonable that God should either not have made them <em>free</em>, of have over-ruled their Freedom? Surely the Author does not subscribe to those <em>Indian</em> Sentiments which he produced immediately before. If it be fit for the Creator to make free Creatures, as it undeniably is; it must be fit, on the same Accounts, to continue to them the Use of that Liberty.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But still it will be asked, Why should their Posterity be <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">be [Suffer-] | Sufferers?</span></span> Sufferers? Why should they feel any Effects of that original Transgression, to which they never consented? Here then I desire to know, whether any Wrong was done them? They had no more Title to the Perfections of the <em>first Man</em>, than they had to the Perfections of an <em>Angel</em>. Whatever occasioned a Diminution of their Privileges, they had more left than they could lay any Claim to. They had still a valuable Remainder; and if they made a good Use of it, they had just Grounds to hope that it would turn to Account. Their <em>State</em> was <em>bad</em>, in Comparison of Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s original State: But what was it, in Comparison of the Creatures below them? In short, No Man living had just Cause to complain of any Corruptions, but those which were strictly and personally his own.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Objections <em>ab Ignorantia</em> are endless. If the Affairs of the World are in the Hands of an infinitely wise Governor, there must unavoidably be many Events, and many Occurrences, utterly incomprehensible to our narrow Minds. How can we imagine ourselves capable of piercing the Secrets of Providence? Can Folly judge of perfect Wisdom, or Ignorance of Omniscience?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever, indeed, is contrary to Truth, or Rectitude, we may safely conclude cannot come from the All-perfect Being. If therefore your Author can shew any thing, in the present Case, repugnant thereto; or, if he can prove the Deity, in any respect, obliged either <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">either [to] | to</span></span> to prevent the Fall of Man, or to hinder the natural Effects of it from descending to Posterity; let him maintain the Integrity and Perfection of Mankind without Opposition.

5. <em>IS not that Law, which is a most perfect Rule to the most perfect Being, perfect enough for his imperfect Creatures? Can this Rule ever lose its Virtue? and will it not now render Men as acceptable to God as ever?</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The <em>Law</em> here spoken of, is not <em>only perfect enough for imperfect Creatures</em>, but <em>too perfect</em>; as I doubt not but your Author has found it, as well as the rest of Mankind. This, Revelation teaches; and universal Experience confirms it. This, <em>Believers</em> confess with Grief and Shame; and if <em>Unbelievers</em> will not join with them in the Acknowledgment of this sad Truth, they are sure to join in the Proof of it; Nay, the less willingly they own it, the more strongly they prove it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;We own, and maintain, that the eternal Law of Reason and Truth is a perfect Rule of Action even to the All-perfect Creator; much more to his Creatures. What would the Author infer from hence? No more than this. Since Men have, and always had, this perfect Law; what Occasion for <em>Prophets</em> and <em>Revelation?</em> I answer, as I did before, That supposing this perfect Law perfectly known; which was not the Case: still they had the same Occasion for <em>Prophets</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Prophets</em> [and] | and</span></span> and <em>Revelation</em>, that they have for <em>Physicians</em> and <em>Medicines</em>. Mankind had broken their Constitution, contracted very ill Habits, and laboured under a Complication of Distempers: Their Vitals were touched, and they were become even <em>sick unto Death</em>. What Means to be used? What Methods to be taken? Your Author prescribes as aforesaid; and argues, that whatever Rule, and whatever Regimen, are sufficient for the soundest Persons, must be sufficient for all Men, and in all Cases.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> he asks, <em>Can this Rule ever lose its Virtue?</em> I answer, It never can. But Men may lose <em>their Virtue:</em> And when this is the Case, they may want such Helps as would be useless to more perfect Creatures; they may want subordinate Rules, to correct their Disorders, strengthen their Minds, and refit them for the Use of the supreme Rule.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Perfection of a Rule is not the only Thing to be considered. That which is <em>absolutely</em> good, and compleat in itself, may be <em>relatively</em> deficient. Regard therefore must be had to the Condition, the Circumstances, and Capacity of the Agent. We know what sort of Rules are usually given to young Children. Should any Man condemn them, and give this Reason for it, That what Rules are proper and <em>perfect enough</em> for grown Men, must needs be proper and <em>perfect enough for imperfect</em> Childhood: what should we think of <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">of [his] | his</span></span> his Judgment? Should we not conclude that he wanted himself some of those Rules which he condemned?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Perhaps this Allusion will be turned against me. Perhaps your Author will ask, upon this Occasion, Does then Christianity consider Men as <em>Minors</em>, and even treat them as <em>Children?</em> In one Sense it certainly does: And however supercilious or self-sufficient some Men may be; however unwilling to acknowledge so disparaging a Truth; most certain it is, that all Mankind have too many of the Weaknesses of Children. It would be well if they resembled them more in some Things. Let them be as much as possible <em>Men in Understanding</em>; but let them not disdain those Qualities, which are so remarkable in Children, and so amiable every-where; their Simplicity, Sincerity, Freedom from Guile, and Love of Truth. Had these generally prevailed, Christianity would never have been corrupted by one Class of Men, nor rejected by another.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to return: Christianity neither abrogates nor discountenances the least Tittle of the Law of Nature: On the contrary, as it sets the whole in the strongest Light; so it earnestly recommends and inculcates, above all Things, the Observation of it. Those additional Rules, and subsidiary Precepts, which we find intermixed, are not intended to supply the Defects of the Law; for there are none such: nor to improve, or exalt it; for that is im<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">im- [possible:] | possible:</span></span>possible: but are designed merely to help our Infirmities, and bring us back to that Line of Duty from which we had swerved. By the Aids of the Gospel, Men are enabled and inclined to act conformably to that glorious Rule; to recover, in some measure, the Dignity of their Nature, and <em>walk worthy</em> of their high and heavenly <em>Vocation</em>.

6. <em><strong>Would</strong> any human Legislator, if he found it for the Good of his Subjects to add new Laws, not promulgate them to all his People? Or can a Being be denominated merciful and good, who is so only to a few, but cruel and unmerciful to the rest?</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That is, if there must be a Revelation, your Author expects it should be universal; communicated equally to all Nations, and in all Ages. Presumptuous Man! Why will he throw himself into such a <em>Dilemma?</em> If his Reasoning hold, it proves a great deal too much: If it do not hold, the Consequence is not only Error, but Blasphemy. If it prove true, that God has ever made a Revelation, at any particular Time, or in any particular Place; then his Wisdom and Goodness are here arraigned, and his Administration censured.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But does this Author really think, that God is obliged to govern the World by such levelling Rules as are here supposed? Is it not undoubted Fact, that <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">that [the] | the</span></span> the Blessings of Heaven are conferred in a quite different Manner? For has not God made some of his Creatures, Angels; some, Men; and some, Insects? Even in the same Species; what Diversity of Talents, and Variety of Conditions? Among Men; are not the <em>High</em> and the <em>Low</em>, the <em>Rich</em> and the <em>Poor</em>, the Learned and the Unlearned, all the Works of his Hands, and the Appointments of his Providence?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What a Handle does such an Argument give for a general Discontent? It directly tends to irritate and excite all the less happy Part of Mankind; to fill their Minds with Sedition, and their Mouths with Clamour.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Would any Man disprove the excessive Heats under the Line; or the extreme Cold of the Polar Regions; this Argument is at his Service. Would he confute the Histories of <em>Greece</em> and <em>Rome</em>; and make it appear that they could not possibly be more knowing, or more learned, than the Nations round about them; the same Argument, if conclusive, will serve his Purpose.

<strong>To</strong> convince you, Sir, that I am not declaiming; nor putting any false Colours on the Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Reasoning; I shall proceed to explain, and enforce what I have said. I have already observed, and it is manifest from all Natural Appearances, that God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>original Gifts</em> are actually dispensed in a very unequal Manner. And forasmuch as all Gifts are, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [must] | must</span></span> must be <em>free</em>; it is evident there cannot be the least Pretence of <em>Injustice</em> in the Case. But the Question is, how such an Inequality is consistent with the <em>Divine Rectitude?</em> For is not God ever influenced and directed by the true <em>Reasons of Things?</em> Most certainly. But then I ask; whether there may not be an Infinity of Reasons quite out of the Reach of all human Sight? Will your Author presume to say, that God can only regard such Reasons as are discoverable by Men? Not only Revelation, but common Sense assures us, that His Reasons and <em>His Ways</em>, must be often <em>past</em> their <em>finding out</em>. The Actions even of wise Men are sometimes conducted by such Rules and Reasons; as ignorant Minds have not the least Glimpse of. How infinitely greater is the Disparity between Human Understanding, and the Divine?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However, we are not entirely in the Dark concerning this Matter. We are able to perceive some Reasons of these Providential Inequalities; and are well acquainted with this general one, which probably holds quite through; <em>viz</em>. that they are essential to the Order of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Works. That Variety, Distinction, Subordination, which are visible every where, and prevail all over the Creation; as they often conduce to the Benefit of Mankind: so, whether they do or not, they are sure to promote the Beauty of Nature, and the Perfection of the Universe.

Let us then consider the Case of <em>Revelation</em>; and see what Difference appears, and what your Author objects.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever Portion of natural Light is possessed by any Man, or is fairly in his Power; he is accountable for that, and that only. It is not expected of him, that he should observe any Laws which were never promulged, or made known to him. Though Revelation would better his Condition; yet many Blessings are enjoyed by him, for which he ought to be thankful. And if he use his best Endeavours in the Improvement of himself; he has just Grounds to hope for many more, and much greater. To represent him therefore as <em>cruelly and unmercifully</em> dealt with, is equally repugnant to Truth and Piety. Does it follow, because he wants those Advantages and Privileges of Revelation which some of his Fellow-Creatures enjoy; that therefore he is ill used? Are all Favours not communicated; Grievances, and Grounds of Complaint? Give such Suppositions as these <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">these [their] | their</span></span> their full Scope; and there would be no such Thing as either Gratitude, or Contentment upon the Face of the Earth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But if it be for the Good of all Men to enjoy Revelation; why is it ever with-held? And if, say I, it be for the Good of all Men to be transformed into Angels; why is it not done? Your Author tells<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> us, that such <em>narrow Notions are inconsistent with the Character of a Being of unlimited Benevolence</em>. I desire to know what he means by <em>unlimited Benevolence</em>. Has he never heard, nor considered, that the Effects of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Power and Benevolence are <em>limited</em> by the Rules of his Wisdom, and the Reasons of Things? Can he imagine that the utmost Possibilities of Good are to be produced at all Times, and in all Places; without Regard to the Order, Proportion, and Harmony of the whole System? Do the Varieties of Providence, and the Inequalities of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Dispensations, appear to this Author, Arguments of <em>Inconstancy in the Divine Conduct?</em> Such a way of thinking is not to be accounted for, unless he suppose, that all the Reasons of Things are within his own Comprehension.

<strong>But</strong> he further objects,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that the Doctrine which he is opposing, <em>supposes Christians to have Means and Opportunities of gaining a higher Degree, or Kind, of Happiness here</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>here</em>- [<em>after</em>] | <em>after</em></span></span><em>after than other Men:</em> which, according to him, is representing the Deity as acting <em>arbitrarily</em>, and <em>partially</em>, and inconsistently with their <em>State of Probation</em>. To act <em>arbitrarily</em>, and <em>partially</em>; is to act without regard to the Right of the Case, and the Reasons of Things. But I presume your Author must mean, either acting without Reason, or from such Reasons as are unknown to <em>him</em>. I have spoken to this Point already; and shall only add, that for him to judge of Providential Dispensations in the Dark; and conclude there are no Reasons, where he can see none, is the utmost Wildness of Imagination. Instead of reverencing the Deity, this may rather be looked upon as deifying himself.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;How, and wherein good Christians will be distinguished hereafter from good Heathens; is a Point not possible for us to determine at present. And indeed it would be Folly to say any thing at all about it; if it were not in some measure necessary, in order to silence so clamorous an Objection.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>What</strong> the Privileges and superior Advantages of Christians <em>will</em> be, I presume not to conjecture: but I humbly suppose they <em>may</em> be, in general, either <em>natural</em> or <em>positive</em>. By <em>natural</em> Advantages, I mean such a superior Degree of Happiness, as is the natural Consequence of superior Improvements in Virtue. These superior Improvements in Virtue may be considered, as the natural Effect <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Effect [of] | of</span></span> of that Opportunity which Providence gave them of becoming Christians. And that Opportunity is what I call an <em>original Gift</em>; which, like other Blessings of the same kind, is conferred in such a Manner, and by such Rules, as are only known to the all-wise Donor. I add, that if the unequal Distribution of these original Gifts be <em>arbitrary</em>; the whole Scale of Created Beings is arbitrary from Top to Bottom. God has indeed a Right to dispense them as He pleases: but whatever is most agreeable to Reason and Rectitude, is sure to please Him best.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To what Purpose does your Author alledge the Certainty of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>rewarding Men according to their Works</em>; when the Question is, whether some Men may not be originally enabled to fit themselves for higher Degrees of Happiness, than others? Or why does he look upon this Diversity of original Gifts as inconsistent with a <em>State of Probation?</em> Whether Men be placed unequally, or all upon a Level, is a Point that no way affects their Probation. In such a State They are tried how they will manage what is committed to their Trust; whether it be more or less. If one Man have originally <em>Two Talents</em>, another <em>Five</em>; though their Conduct, if equal, will be equally approved; yet the original Difference may remain, and be perpetuated. In short, different Degrees of Happiness as naturally result from different Improvements; as <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">as [different] | different</span></span> different Improvements are produced by different Opportunities.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> further: Good Christians may not only have <em>natural</em> Advantages hereafter, above Heathens, but likewise <em>positive</em> ones. If your Author can find no Reason for such Distinctions, I shall endeavour to point it out to him. I will not urge, that <em>many Mansions</em> Above may be as fitting as many Ranks and Degrees here Below: Nor will I inquire whether such Distinctions may not contribute to the Order and Perfection of a heavenly State, as well as an earthly one. I only ask, Whether the <em>Body</em> of faithful Christians may not be justly distinguished from a Regard to their meritorious <em>Head?</em> Whether, on <em>His</em> Account, they may not have good Reason to hope for such a Pre-eminence? If the highest Honours be due to Him; is it not natural to conclude, that some Share will redound to Those who stand in a peculiar Relation to Him? And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Opportunity of entering into such a Relation was the original Favour of Heaven; yet that alters not the Case, nor is any Ground for Objection; as hath been already shewn. No Reason can be alledged against it, but what equally holds against the superior Advantages of Angels. Imparity and Distinction in the same Species, may be as agreeable to Order and Rectitude, as the Subordination of one Species to another.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whereas then <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">then [your] | your</span></span> your Author complains of <em>some People being made Favourites, without any Consideration of their Merits</em>; he is desired to view this Matter in another Light. Strictly speaking, we contend only for <em>one Favourite</em>, one illustrious Favourite, whose Merits are unquestionable, and most abundant. The nearer any Part of Mankind stand to <em>Him</em>, the greater Lustre they derive from Him, and the more glorious is their Situation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Nor is there any Thing in this Account tending to the Disadvantage or Diminution of any moral Worth. No good Work can be lost; no Virtue fall to the Ground. Whoever has done well, or endeavoured well, according to his Abilities, will receive in full Proportion. Nay, he will receive, through the Merits above mentioned, vastly beyond his Proportion. But let him not complain, if others be preferred and distinguished, on <em>His</em> Account, who has merited largely for all; and more-especially for his immediate Servants, and peculiar People. If such Benefits are, through Him, derived on the whole Race of Mankind; let it not seem strange, if, in Consideration of His transcendent Merit, some particular Honours and Distinctions be reserved for His own proper Family.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return: It appears, from what has been said, that your Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Objection is partly founded on a Mistake in Fact. The Christian Dispensation is in some sense <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">sense [universal;] | universal;</span></span> universal; though the Light of the Gospel has not yet been every-where enjoyed. The Benefits of it reach backwards to the Creation; and forward to the Consummation: comprehending at the same time, all People, and, Nations, and Languages. Our Redeemer, far from being partial, has grasped the whole Globe; and extended the chief of his Blessings over all the Ends of the Earth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Thus then does your Author partly argue against Fact, partly against the Reason of Things, and wholly without Evidence. His Argument wanders entirely in the Dark; and from unknown Premises, concludes at a Venture.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Upon</strong> the whole: Whoever is disposed to think soberly, will be little moved by such Objections as are here offered. He will perceive it to be the Duty and the Wisdom of every Rational Creature, to be content with that State in which he is placed, and thankful for the Blessings that he enjoys; to make the best Use he can of what is committed to his Trust, and leave the rest to Providence. But to confront Evidence with Conjecture, and Facts with Imaginations; to measure the Counsels of Heaven by his short Views, and broken Conceptions; and to conclude that the World must needs be ordered, in every Particular, according to his poor Schemes: will appear highly impertinent, arrogant, and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [profane.] | profane.</span></span> profane.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only add, in respect of your Author, what was formerly said of another Person, on another Occasion; <em>Monendus est</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>desinat esse rector mundi</em>.

7. <em>IF<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Christianity, as well as Deism; consists in being governed by the Obligations of moral Fitness; must they not both be the same?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Such Discoveries as these must needs be very edifying; and conduce much both to the Peace of our Minds, and the Prosperity of our Understandings. How wonderfully would Religious Knowledge be promoted in this Nation, if the <em>idle, haranguing Drones</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> would but retire, and give Way to this <em>industrious Bee</em>; who, after a long Search through the Fields of Truths, returns laden with such precious Spoils as these? But what will you say, Sir, if, instead of extracting the Sweets of Flowers, he feed only on poisonous Weeds; and instead of <em>Honey</em>, give us <em>Hemlock?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Christianity and Deism the same?</em> Why then does he differ with us? and what is it that we are contesting? That he should misapprehend <em>Christianity</em>, may be no great Wonder: but it might well be expected that he should understand <em>Deism</em>. Yet I venture to affirm, that he has here misrepresented both. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">both. [&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Nei-] | &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Neither</span></span> &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Neither <em>Christianity</em>, nor <em>Deism</em>, <em>consists in being governed by the Obligations of moral Fitness</em>. To be governed by these, is <em>moral Virtue</em>, properly so called; which equally binds the whole Species; considered as Men, or <em>moral Agents:</em> but cannot be the Characteristick, or distinguishing Principle, of either <em>Deists</em>, or <em>Christians</em>. <em>Deism</em> consists in being governed by the Obligations of <em>Natural Religion:</em> and Natural Religion consists in Obedience to the Will of God, as made known by the Light of Nature and Reason; as Christianity consists in Obedience to the same Will, as made known by the Revelation of Jesus Christ. To do Actions because they are <em>right</em> in themselves, is to be governed by <em>moral Fitness:</em> but <em>Religion</em>, whether <em>natural</em> or <em>revealed</em>, obliges Men to do them, because they are <em>commanded</em>. An <em>Atheist</em> may be governed by <em>moral Fitness</em>; and, probably, will, when there is no Temptation to hinder him. With what Propriety then can <em>Deism</em> be said to consist in those Obligations which are incumbent on the very <em>Atheists</em>; and, indeed, equally affect all rational Agents? I confess, indeed, what the Author adds, is a sufficient Distinction from <em>Atheism</em>; but does by no means come up to the Obligations even of <em>Deism</em>. The primary Idea of <em>Religion</em>, whether natural or revealed, is not an <em>Imitation</em> of the Deity, or <em>a Conformity to his Nature</em>; but <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">but [<em>Obedi</em>-] | <em>Obedience</em></span></span> <em>Obedience</em> to his Will. Whoever owns a God, must acknowledge his Authority; and to <em>obey</em> that Authority, is, properly, being governed by the Obligations of Religion.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If then <em>Christianity</em> and <em>Deism</em> must be identify<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d by this Author, I presume he must find some other Argument for the doing of it. And, in the mean time, I hope I may conclude, that since <em>neither Christianity, nor Deism, consists in being governed by moral Fitness</em>, they may, possibly, be <em>not not [sic] the same</em>.

8. <sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup><em>ARE not God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Commands to be measured by the antecedent Fitness of Things? And can Things be said to be fit, or unfit, otherwise than as they are for or against the Common Good</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Antecedent Fitness, though a good Rule, as far as it reaches; yet, in respect of Men, is neither universal, nor infallible. The Will of God is, in itself, always measurable by moral <em>Fitness</em>; but our Ideas of moral <em>Fitness</em> are not always to be depended on; as being sometimes obscure, and very often inadequate. In some Cases, what is really <em>fit</em>, appears to us <em>unfit</em>; and <em>vic&ecirc; vers&acirc;</em>. Where the <em>Fitness</em> of Things is dark and dubious, and the Divine <em>Command</em> clear and certain; can it be any Question, whether the former is not to be measured by the latter? Your Author writes, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">writes, [as] | as</span></span> as if all the Relations of Things were as plain and familiar to him as the Letters of the Alphabet. I have several Reasons to wish that he would be less sanguine; but at present shall only take notice of that which falls in my way.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Notwithstanding the Magnificence of his Book, the Importance of his Design, the Variety of his Arguments, and the Terror of his Threats; though he handle Religion so magisterially, and treat of moral Subjects so dictatorially; though he be every-where so full of Reasons, Relations, Fitnesses, and the like: I cannot find, after all, that he so much as understands what <em>Moral Fitness</em> is; or, indeed, that he has any Idea of it&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Fitness</em> to promote <em>natural Good</em>, whether publick or private; is not <em>moral</em>, but <em>natural Fitness</em>. <em>Moral Fitness</em> is the <em>Conformity</em> of <em>moral Actions to Truth</em> and <em>Rectitude</em>; and can be nothing else, whether it promote <em>natural Good</em>, or not. It is, doubtless, <em>morally fit</em> to promote the Common Good; but, surely, it does not follow from hence, that <em>moral Fitness</em> entirely consists in so doing.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Even the old <em>wandering Philosophers</em> never lost themselves so far (the most and the best of them at least) as to confound the <em>Rectum</em> and the <em>Utile</em>. Take <em>Cicero</em><span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s short Account of the Matter; <em>Optimi quique permulta ob eam unam causam faciunt: quia decet, quia rectum, quia honestum est: etsi nullum conjecuturum emolumentum vident</em>. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>vident</em>. [But,] | But,</span></span> But, perhaps, they meant no more by <em>Honesty</em> and <em>Rectitude</em>, than sacrificing private Interest to <em>common Good</em>. It is evident to me, that they did mean more than this: But instead of Words, let us consider Actions. I appeal to you, Sir, who are so well versed in History, whether the great Men among the Antients were wholly governed by Views of <em>Utility</em>, either publick or private. I doubt not but you will allow, that many of the antient <em>Romans</em> would utterly have refused, either to violate their Oaths, or falsify their Words, though in order to save their <em>Capitol</em>. If it be said, that they might be influenced by Views of Futurity; your Author has precluded himself from such a Supposition, by representing these as <em>servile Motives</em>, and, by Consequence, unworthy of such great Minds. However this might be, you will own some of them Men of such true Honour, that they could not endure the very Idea of a base Action. They loved their <em>Country</em> well, but <em>Truth</em> and <em>Virtue</em> better.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I find</strong> your Author sometimes joins the <em>Glory of God</em> to the <em>common Good</em>. But though he speaks of them as of <em>two</em> Ends, he considers them but as <em>one</em>. Perhaps he will urge, that they are inseparable. If they may not be separated, they may and ought to be distinguished.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Truth</em> and <em>Rectitude</em> are not only <em>beneficial</em>; are not only amiable and beautiful; but they are really <em>divine</em>. For <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">For [<em>God</em>] | <em>God</em></span></span> <em>God is Truth</em>, in a Sense more than figurative; all eternal Truths being necessary Emanations from the Infinite Mind. To act conformably therefore to <em>Truth</em>, is to glorify the <em>God of Truth</em>. If an <em>Atheist</em>, in any of his Actions, is governed by <em>moral Fitness</em>, or a Regard to <em>Truth</em> and <em>Right</em>; he so far pays Homage, though unintended, to that God whom he disowns. But they who own a God, must actually intend this Homage. And let me add, that he is no <em>true Deist</em>, who, on the Supposition of an Interference, would sacrifice this End to either private or publick Advantage.

9. <sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup><em>CAN he who does a Thing to avoid being punished, or in hopes of being rewarded hereafter; merit equally with him who is in love with his Duty; and is governed not by servile Motives, but by the original Obligation of the moral Fitness of Things?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;How does your Author delight in Extremes! The <em>common Good</em>, he makes every thing; and private Good, nothing. <em>Moral Fitness</em> is, it seems, no more than a Tendency to promote the former; and all Regards to the latter are mercenary Views; and <em>servile Motives</em>, below the Dignity of human Nature.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I desire to know, whether an Agent is to aim at the Publick Good; exclusively of his own, or inclusively? If exclusively, he <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">he [aims] | aims</span></span> aims at a Good less publick than he might do; and at the same time unnaturally makes himself a kind of an Outlaw. If inclusively, why not in the Views of another Life, as well as of this? Is it <em>servile</em> for a Man to propose his own Happiness, either present, or future, in Conjunction with that of his Fellow-Creatures? Let it be allowed your Author, that Disinterestedness renders Actions and Agents much more perfect: still his Notion is unsound, and even extravagant. As I formerly observed, it cannot well be considered otherwise, in respect of Mankind, than as a sort of religious <em>Knight-Errantry</em>. Whatever may be the Case of superior Beings; whatever some Men have professed, and others practised; a Conduct entirely disinterested, is above the Principles of human Nature. Many things may be done merely for Virtue<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s sake; but every thing cannot. The Love of God and Goodness is a powerful and glorious Principle; but in the Mind of such a Creature as Man, it cannot possibly reign alone. And the Reason is, because he is a <em>sensible,</em> as well as a <em>moral Agent</em>;<em></em> and as such, must have two distinct Ends, and be obliged to pursue both. In the one Capacity he is obliged to aim at <em>Virtue</em>, in the other at <em>natural Good</em>.

<strong>It</strong> must be agreeable to natural Religion, as well as Revealed, for Men to look forward, and keep open their Prospect into another <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">another [World.] | World.</span></span> World. Without a Regard to Futurity, their Principles must be precarious; and their Integrity depend very much on the Accidents of Life. The more a Man is <em>in love with his Duty</em>, and the further he sees into the Excellence of Virtue; the wiser, the better, and the happier he is. Let his Obligations to God and Goodness influence him at all times as far as possible. But in the Day of Adversity, or even Prosperity; in Times of Tryal and Temptation; the Motives of Religion are absolutely necessary. Either the Beauty of Virtue will fade in his Eyes, or he will be in no Condition to mind it. Strong Fear, or violent Pain, or excessive Grief, or immoderate Joy, or profuse Pleasure, would naturally dissipate his Thoughts, and draw off his Attention; if those powerful Motives were not at hand, to counterbalance his Affections, and keep him steady.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Besides, Are not those future Rewards which Revelation sets before us, summed up as it were, in the eternal Enjoyment of Virtue? At least, this will be the principal Ingredient. And from hence it follows, that the more any Man is in love with Virtue, the more desirous he must be of those Rewards.

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>THE Reader is desired to excuse these Remarks thrown in his Way. As they are Supplemental to another Tract, I might have found another Place for them. But since they appeared no improper Introduction to the following Essay; I chose to prefix them here.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
THAT the eternal Truth and Reason of Things universally directs and obliges all Moral Agents, and even the Deity Himself; seemed to me some time ago a Point scarce controvertible. Without stopping therefore at this, I endeavoured to shew in a former Paper, that a perpetual Conformity to Truth is the clearest Idea we can have of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Moral Perfection; which being exhibited to the Mind in the mixed Light of various At</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>At</em>- [<em>tributes</em>,] | <em>tributes</em>,</span></span><em>tributes, was, I thought, more obscurely and imperfectly conceived. But since the very Foundation of that Doctrine is rejected by Some, and suspected by Others; I judge it necessary to give it a more particular Examination, before I proceed to the Remainder of my Design. 
</em>
<em>THEY who ascribe the Rectitude of the Divine Actions to the Perfection of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s</em> Will<em>; must either mean his Will as</em> directed<em>, or as</em> undirected<em>. If as</em> undirected;<em> what do they mean by the Perfection of such a Will? A perfect Will conformable to no Rule, and directed by Nothing; appears to me very absurd, or altogether unintelligible. According to my Apprehensions, the Perfection of Will essentially consists in a strict and uninterrupted</em> Conformity <em>to some proper Rule: forasmuch as to act without such a Rule; is to act,</em> arbitrarily<em>, capriciously, and at Random. If any Agent can Shew Cause, why he acted after one manner rather than another; he has followed some Rule: if he can shew no Cause; whatever be the Effect or Tendency of his Actions, they are utterly irreconcilable with the lowest Degree of Wisdom; how much more with the highest?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short; to suppose the Will of the Supreme Agent under no Direction, and uninfluenced by the Dictates of his own unerring Understanding; is to suppose Darkness</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Darkness</em> [<em>where</em>] | <em>where</em></span></span> <em>where there is nothing but Light, and the most perfect Counsel set aside for the Sake of Chance and Confusion.
</em>
<em>On the other hand, if by the Will of God he meant his Will as directed; then I beg Leave to ask, what can be supposed to direct it but</em> Reason <em>and</em> Truth? <em>Or, in other Words, what so proper and likely to direct the Divine</em> Will<em>, as the Divine</em> Understanding<em>, the Source of all Reason, and the Fountain of all Truth? The Scripture expressly mentions the</em> Counsel of <em>God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s</em> Will<em>. Are we to understand by this</em> Counsel<em>,</em> Truth<em>, or</em> Affection; Rectitude<em>, or</em> Benevolence? <em>Whether of these Principles tends to produce in our Minds, juster, worthier, and more honourable Conceptions of the Deity; that by all means ought to have the Preference. Let us consider and compare them together.</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Benevolence</strong> <em>is either</em> Rational<em>, as founded on Reason, and produced by it; or a</em> Natural Affection<em>, a physical Disposition, distinct from Reason, and independent on it.</em> Rational Benevolence <em>coincides with the Principle for which I contend, or results from it. The Natural Disposition, or the</em> Affection of Benevolence<em>, cannot, I think, be properly considered as any Branch of</em> Moral Perfection: <em>and if it could, would nevertheless be much inferior to the Principle of</em> Rectitude<em>. It <nobr>can<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">can- [not] | not</span></span>not</nobr> be looked upon as a</em> moral <em>Perfection, or indeed a</em> rational <em>Principle; unless it be either produced, or directed by</em> Reason<em>, or both; which are all contrary to the Supposition. It may have, in many Cases, the Approbation and Concurrence of Reason; and they may jointly promote the same Ends: Yet still, I presume, this is not sufficient to bring it under the Denomination of a Moral Principle.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But whatever it may be reputed, or called; if the Merits of it be examined; it will be found, if I mistake not, so far from excelling or equalling the Principle of Rectitude, that it will by no means bear a Comparison. We shall soon be convinced of this; if we consider the two Principles as we find them exercised and exerted among Men.</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Human Benevolence</strong>, <em>considered as a natural Affection, is commonly, and indeed very properly, called</em> Good-nature<em>. For</em> Goodness of Nature <em>it really is; as consisting of a high degree of that</em> Social Instinct<em>, which God has been pleased to plant variously in the Minds of Men. And however desirable, however amiable this Principle may appear; yet in fineness, and morally speaking, it is the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Goodness, and not the Creature<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s. He who possesses it, is only the Possessor of it. The natural Influence and Operation of it is, in him, no Merit at all; unless it may be accounted Merit that he does not resist the Bent of his Nature. As far as he actually complies with</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>with</em> [<em>it</em>;] | <em>it</em>;</span></span> <em>it; as far as he cherishes and strengthens it by Reason and Reflection; so far he is praise-worthy: but otherwise neither the Impulses of the Affection, nor the Effects produced by it, can justly be placed to his Account. Though therefore this natural Benevolence be a great Help to Virtue; yet of itself it is not Virtue, as I have elsewhere observed. Men may have it, and yet be vicious; or they may want it, and yet be virtuous. A high Degree of it may make Men almost passive in Acts of Kindness; as it gives their Minds so strong a Bias towards such Acts, that the very Forbearance of them is a kind of Violence and Self-denial. On which Account, as may be observed by the Way, much greater Improvements in Virtue and Goodness are doubtless expected from such Persons.
</em>
</div>

<em>ON the other hand, if we consider the Principle of</em> Rectitude<em>, even</em> human Rectitude; <em>we shall not find it thus empty and worthless in a Moral Account. Freely to chuse what is most worthy to be chosen; and to determine, and do, what is right and fit in itself for that very Reason because it is so; must either be an Action morally good and meritorious, or Man is not capable of either doing or conceiving such an Action. For this is chusing an Object simply good</em> in itself<em>, and paying that Homage to Truth and Righteousness which is naturally and necessarily due. It is acting most</em> freely, <em>be</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>be</em>- [<em>cause</em>] | <em>cause</em></span></span><em>cause without any antecedent Propension. And it is acting from a Principle as</em> disinterested <em>as any Benevolence can possibly be. Where these Characters concur, they must either produce Moral Worth; or there neither is, nor can be, any such Thing in the World.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To ask why there is more Desert in doing</em> right<em>, than in doing</em> wrong<em>; is the same Thing as to ask, why</em> Truth <em>is better than</em> Error<em>;</em> Light <em>than</em> Darkness<em>;</em> Pleasure <em>than</em> Pain<em>: the Absurdity of all which Questions is alike self-evident. The Querist need only be put in Mind of the necessary Natures of Things, which he must find essentially different. And the Actions of Moral Agents are as different in their own Nature, as any Things whatever. If</em> Happiness <em>be in itself preferable to</em> Misery<em>; an Action productive of</em> Happiness <em>must be, in itself better than an Action productive of</em> Misery: <em>the Effect, in one Case, having a real absolute Value; in the other, being worse than nothing. And the like Difference is observable between</em> right <em>and</em> wrong <em>Actions; even supposing them to have no Connexion with any Happiness or Natural Good.</em> Conformity to Truth <em>is, in itself, as different from</em> Iniquity<em>, as</em> Pleasure <em>is from</em> Pain<em>.</em> Gratitude <em>to a Benefactor would be better, infinitely better, than</em> Ingratitude<em>; though the Person obliged were utterly incapable of making the least Requital, or the Benefactor</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Benefactor</em> [<em>of</em>] | <em>of</em></span></span> <em>of receiving any. Which is actually the Case between Man and his Maker. This Difference of Actions is not arbitrary, or factitious; but necessary and unchangeable, as the Rule by which they are directed. The</em> Rule of Truth<em> being, in its own Nature, the best Rule that is possible to be followed, or conceived; acting conformably to it must needs be the most worthy Action; supposing, as above, that the Agent<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Choice of it is entirely</em> free <em>and</em> disinterested<em>. If it be, in some measure, owing to a physical Predetermination of his Mind; or to Views of Interest; the Action is in Proportion less pure and perfect.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To say that the Rule of Truth is no otherwise to be regarded, or valued, than as it conduces to</em> Pleasure <em>or</em> Profit<em>; is, in Effect, denying the very Existence of</em> Moral Good<em>, and desecrating the most sacred Thing in the World. But this Point will come again under Consideration in the following Tract.
</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>IT may perhaps be here urged that the Conformity of Mens Actions to such a Rule, can however be no Desert in</em> Them<em>. At least that the same Abatements and Diminutions are to be allowed here, which were insisted on before in respect of</em> Natural Benevolence. <em>If Men deserve little or nothing by such Actions as are owing to</em> Natural Affection; <em>must not the same be granted of those which are owing to supernatural Assis</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Assis</em>- [<em>tance?</em>] | <em>tance?</em></span></span><em>tance? And is not this the Case of all our good Actions?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I answer, that the Principles of</em> Nature <em>and</em> Grace <em>are widely different. The latter, as we may reasonably suppose, acting only on the Mind,</em> intellectually<em>,</em> morally<em>, and</em> persuasively<em>; while the former act</em> physically<em>,</em> efficiently<em>, and are, as it were, real</em> Stimuli<em>. Had Men the same Natural Impulsions to virtuous Actions in general, that they have to Acts of Kindness towards their nearest Relations; then indeed their moral Character, and the Worth of their virtuous Deeds would sink, in Proportion. But supernatural Influences are of a quite different kind. They neither infringe nor any way interfere with Human Liberty; which, as far as we can judge, is the same with them, or without them.</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>HOWEVER, it is needless to enlarge on this Point, as being, in respect of the Deity, quite out of the Case. As He is incapable of any foreign Influences, the Goodness of his Actions can only be derived from his own inherent Perfections. And whether it be more conducive to his Honour, and more agreeable to Reason and Revelation, to ascribe them to</em> moral <em>Perfection, or</em> natural; <em>is a Question, if it be a Question, that well deserves to be considered. For a</em> natural <em>Perfection it must be, according to the Opinion which I am opposing; and of such a Kind too, as seems to tend to the Diminution of his</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>his</em> [<em>Moral</em>] | <em>Moral</em></span></span> <em>Moral Character. I mean while it is represented as the Ground and Principle of his Actions; since the Influence of Truth and Reason must be supposed less in Proportion to the Efficacy of the</em> affectionate <em>Principle.
</em>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>IF all the Favours of Heaven sprung, merely from</em> Benevolence<em>, in the Sense of</em> Natural Affection; <em>it would follow, according to the foregoing Account of this Principle, that they were</em> less free<em>, if not</em> necessary: <em>which Consequence is injurious to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Honour, not only in the forementioned Respect; but likewise as it proportionably diminishes the Obligations of his Creatures. If that Immensity of Good which fills the Universe, was entirely the Effect of a natural Necessity; They would be under no Obligation at all. And to suppose it only resulting from a Determination not perfectly free; must, by Consequence, lessen those Obligations in proportion to such a Diminution of Freedom.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be said, that there is no arguing from</em> Human <em>Benevolence, to</em> Divine<em>; nor from the Operations of the One, to the Operations of the Other; this is not untying, but cutting the Knot. For if we argue at all on the Subject; we must argue from the Ideas of Human Perfections to those of Divine; since we can have no Idea at all of the latter; but what is derived from the former, with the Addition of Infinity. And whatever we find in ourselves; no supposed Perfection ought we to</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>to</em> [<em>ascribe</em>] | <em>ascribe</em></span></span> <em>ascribe to God, which interferes with a greater Perfection.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Should it be urged, that according to the other Opinion, God</em> necessarily <em>conforms his Actions to the</em> Rule of Rectitude;<em> the Answer is, that the Necessity here meant is improperly so called. A</em> Moral Necessity <em>is so very different from</em> Natural<em>, that it is consistent with the most perfect Freedom. If the</em> Reasons <em>and</em> Relations <em>of Things were destructive of</em> Liberty<em>, or inconsistent with it, no such Power could possibly have existed. But however they may incline, or influence, they can have no Degree of</em> Efficiency<em>. Certain therefore it is, that notwithstanding an Infinity of Moral Truths is ever before Him, and all of them have that Weight with Him which respectively belongs to them; God is nevertheless absolutely free in all his Actions and Determinations.

<em>SUPPOSING the Benevolence of the Deity a mere physical Propension, undirected by any other Principle; supposing it either unlimited, or limited by sole Will and Pleasure; would it not follow from hence, that no</em> Rational <em>Account could be given of his Proceedings, even by Himself? And must not that be a strange Opinion, which represents the wisest and most rational of all Beings, as acting all along without Regard to Reason? I include not here Cases indifferent; which neither require a particular Reason, nor admit of any. It is surely no indifferent Matter</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Matter</em> [<em>whether</em>] | <em>whether</em></span></span> <em>whether the Creator be beneficent to his Creatures, or unbeneficent. If then it be said, that to an Agent of Power, there is always a Reason for Beneficence, when there is none against it; I say the same. Is then that Reason regarded by the Deity, or is it not? If it be; then He so far acts on the Principle of</em> Rectitude; <em>if it be not, how shall we avoid, the forementioned Consequence?
</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<aside class="sidenote">
<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> It may not perhaps be improper to specify a Supposition, in order to see how the Consequence would rise. The moral Impossibility of the Thing can be no Obstruction to such a Design. Let it then be supposed, that some great and general Good depended on the utter Ruin and endless Misery of an innocent Individual. I need not ask, whether the Deity would consent to such a dreadful Expedient; since I doubt not but it would be universally answered in the Negative. From hence then I conclude, that the Production of Natural Good cannot be the supreme End; for if it was, the Case would not only admit, but unavoidably require a contrary Decision.</span>
<span>I beg leave to observe further, what may deserve to be considered by all who acknowledge the Gospel, that supposing the Principle of <em>Rectitude</em> inferior and subordinate to that of Benevolence, it would be very hard to give an Account, why <em>the First and great Commandment</em> stands not in the <em>Second</em> Place, and the Second in the First. By the Discharge of our Duty towards God, we can no way profit Him, however we may serve our selves. By that towards our Neighbour, we directly promote both his Welfare and our own: So that, in respect of <em>Benevolence</em>, this Branch of Duty must claim the Pre-eminence. But if we examine by the Principle of <em>Rectitude</em>, we shall soon find the Scale turn strongly the other way; for as much as there is no Comparison between our Obligations to the Creator, and those to our Fellow-creatures&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I shall only add, that ascribing the Supremacy to the Principle of Natural Good, seems to me to convert all Morality into a mere Scheme of Politicks; which, as I apprehend, is neither consistent with the Honour of God, nor the Dignity of Virtue.<span>
</aside>
<em>AGAIN; if the sole, or predominant principle of the Divine Actions be a Natural Affection, and that Affection a bound less Benevolence; then to this, as Supreme, all other Principles must be, at least, Subordinate. All Regards, Views, and Intentions whatever, must continually give Place to it, and make way for it. I ask then, Whether it can be supposed, that God would violate or counteract Truth in any Instance; if from his so doing, Benefit would redound to his Creatures? Were it possible for Him to double the Happiness of the Universe by a single<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Violation of Right and Truth; I hope I shall</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>shall</em> [<em>be</em>] | <em>be</em></span></span> <em>be allowed to affirm, that he would certainly refuse it. I presume it is utterly inconsistent with the Divine Purity and Perfection, to submit to the least Degree of</em> Moral Evil; <em>whatever</em> Natural Good <em>might be produced thereby.

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>IN this Sense, if I mistake not, God is said to</em> glorify <em>Himself. And in this Sense He indispensibly requires that all his intelligent Creatures glorify him; viz. by an inviolable Regard to</em> Truth <em>and</em> Righteousness<em>. And hence it appears, why the Good of Mankind, and all other Views whatever, are in Scripture constantly postponed to the</em> Glory of God;<em> which, I think, primarily consists, not in the Communication of</em> Natural Good, <em>as it is commonly represented; but in the Maintenance and Establishment of</em> Moral <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Moral [Truth] | Truth</span></span> Truth <em>and</em> Rectitude. <em>To this sacred and supreme Rule all Things must bend, and all Agents submit. It is essentially glorious in itself; and as such, claims the strictest Regard, Reverence and Homage, from all rational Beings. We are to observe it not only on our own Accounts; but as it is a Duty necessarily incumbent on us, and results from the holy and divine Nature of the Rule it self. It is very true that our chief Happiness confess in thus glorifying God: but that this is the sole, or even chief Reason for our doing it, must not be allowed. Whatever become of our</em> Interest; <em>whether our</em> Advantages <em>be greater or less;</em> Truth <em>is</em> Truth<em>, and</em> Right <em>is</em> Right; <em>demanding, and indeed deserving the Attention, Veneration, and Observance of every Moral Agent, from its own essential Excellence, and intrinsick Authority. In short; to act conformably hereto, and make it our supreme End; is, I am persuaded, in the truest and most proper Sense of the Word;</em> glorifying <em>God; to whom it belongs, and whose Nature it is, essentially and immutably.

<div class="indented numbered">
ONCE more; whereas it is objected, that though in the Idea of</em> Rectitude <em>the Deity appears more awful, yet in that of</em> Benevolence <em>he appears more amiable; the Answer is obvious. Awfulness and Amiableness are no way inconsistent. If the Notion of Rectitude represents the Deity as awful; which in a proper Sense of the Word is just and fitting; it</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>it</em> [<em>also</em>] | <em>also</em></span></span> <em>also represents him as infinitely amiable. A Being who is supposed never to act arbitrarily, never partially, never weakly; but in all his Dealings and Proceedings with a whole Universe of Creatures, is ever directed by perfect Reason, Order and Truth; is, I think, not only the most glorious, but the most lovely Character that can possibly enter into the Mind either, of Man or Angel. Nothing can be conceived more excellent in it self, or more suitable to the Divine Majesty.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To make the Advancement of our Interest the Measure of Amiableness, and the Rule of Goodness; is the way to manifest, not</em> Divine Perfections<em>, but</em> Human Imperfections<em>. More Zeal for God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Glory, and less for our own Advantage, would soon rectify this Manner of thinking. In such Inquiries as these, it would be proper, as much as may be, to lay aside our</em> Sensibility<em>; and taking Counsel only of our</em> Understandings<em>, to consider carefully wherein the highest Perfection of a Moral Agent consists. If we find, as surely we must, that supposing him acting from mere undirected Will, or a physical Propension, or indeed any Principle independent on Truth and Reason, cannot be the most, perfect Way of acting; nor in Reality any Moral Perfection at all; we shall never ascribe it to the Deity, whatever Natural Good might be expected from it.

<em>WE are such indigent, and at the same time such frail and faulty Creatures, that we</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>we</em> [<em>are</em>] | <em>are</em></span></span> <em>are very apt to confine the Moral Perfection of the Deity to the Ideas of Benevolence and Mercy; and oftentimes we frame such Conceptions of both, as are rather agreeable to our Wants and Wishes, than to our impartial Judgments.

Instead of consulting their Understandings, they are determined by their Bowels. They readily restore to Favour not only those who are proper Objects of Favour, but Those who are not; heaping upon them mischievous Kindnesses without Measure or Distinction. In this manner they act, not because it is just, and right, and fit; but because they relent, and are hurried away by fond Instincts and over-ruling Affections. Such Proceedings as these are below even</em> Human <em>Wisdom; how much more</em> Divine?

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Divine? [<em>IT</em>] <em>IT</em></span></span> 
<em>IT seems to me highly improbable, thus the</em> Will <em>of the Deity should be</em> undirected <em>even in the Creation and original Constitution of the World. To suppose the Creator fixing and ranging his Creatures arbitrarily, and without Ride; appears not consistent with the Perfection of his Conduct. Nothing can be more absurd than to imagine an infinitely wise Being determining and acting without Reason; except in such Cases as admit of none. Whether the Powers and Capacities of his Creatures should be</em> equal <em>or</em> unequal<em>, could certainly be no indifferent Matter. The latter, we find, was determined; and undoubtedly there was good Reason for it, whether we be able to discover it, or not. Perhaps various Reasons might concur in recommending such a Constitution. But to suppose it resulting from mere Will, is manifestly injurious to the Divine Wisdom.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If any one certain</em> Order <em>of the Universe be more agreeable to Truth than another; it may justly be concluded that such an Order would be approved and preferred on that very Account; since it is natural to suppose, that a perfect Agent must intend the Perfection of his own Works. It is likewise equally certain, that a wise and good Creator must propose the</em> Well-being <em>of his Creatures. If that</em> Order <em>of the Universe which constitutes its Perfection, be productive of, or consistent with, the highest Degrees of</em> Happiness; <em>there might so far be Grounds to conclude, that both</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>both</em> [<em>these</em>] | <em>these</em></span></span> <em>these Ends are proposed in their utmost Extent. But if, on the contrary, the Perfection of the Universe will not admit of the utmost Possibilities of Natural Good; the Consequence must be, I humbly apprehend, a suitable Limitation. That Scale of Beings, that Subordination of Creatures, which we find in Fact established; as it manifestly contributes to the Order, and, Beauty, and Perfection of the Whole; so it appears no less manifestly inconsistent with such Communications of Good as fall within our Conceptions. Thus, for Instance, had Men been formed with</em> Angelick <em>Capacities; they would have been qualified for higher Degrees of Happiness; and that, in all Probability, without diminishing, or any way interfering with the Enjoyments of Angels. But whatever further Reasons there might be against such a Constitution, which I shall not presume to guess at; it appears evidently repugnant to. the forementioned Order and Perfection of the Universe; which plainly seem to require, not only an Inequality of the Powers and Capacities of Creatures; but a gradual Subordination through all the Degrees of Intelligence, Perception, and Life.</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>Yet how uncertain must be the Continuance of this, or any other Constitution; supposing it originally determined by undirected Will? In vain is it granted that certain Relations necessarily flow from the Original Frame of the World; if that Frame, was the Result of a</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>a</em> [<em>mere</em>] | <em>mere</em></span></span> <em>mere arbitrary Appointment. Neither the original Frame, nor the Relations consequent thereupon, can thus have any Stability. If there is every Moment full Power to produce a Change, and no Reason supposed to dissuade from it; which is the very Case that we are considering; what should hinder us at any Time from apprehending a general Revolution? If the Divine</em> Will <em>produced the Universe, and modelled it as it is, without any Regard to</em> Reason <em>and</em> Truth; <em>why may not the same Will either change or abolish it the same Way?
</em>
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>THE plain Truth is, that the</em> Reasons and Relations of Things <em>neither depend on the present Constitution of the Worlds nor on the Will of the Creator. They are, and must be eternally the same; whatever Schemes be fixed, or Successions ordered. And as to</em> moral Relations <em>in particular; they are manifestly independent and Immutable; in whatever State or Situation, rational Creatures be supposed to be placed.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;We may conceive indeed Human Nature so framed; that the Relations of</em> Princes <em>and</em> Subjects<em>,</em> Parents <em>and</em> Children<em>,</em> Masters <em>and</em> Servants, &c<em>. should have no Place in our Duty but lie dormant, as it were, in respect of Mankind. Nevertheless these Relations, and all Truths connected with them, would be in themselves, that is in the Divine Understanding, precisely what they now are.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Besides; however the intelligent World had been constituted; the main Lines,</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Lines</em>, [<em>and</em>] | <em>and</em></span></span> <em>and general Duties of Morality must have been in a great measure, always the same; whatever Difference might have appeared in the Specifications thereof. Whatever State of things be supposed; all Rational Creatures must have found themselves obliged to the Love, Honour, Reverence, and Obedience of their Creator; to universal Justice, Fidelity, and Benevolence towards their Fellow-creatures; and to subject all their Actions and Affections to the Rule and Supremacy of right Reason. For these general Obligations are necessarily and invariably incumbent on all intelligent Creatures, however constituted.</em> 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<em>SHOULD we suppose</em> moral Relations <em>wholly dependent on the Divine</em> Will; <em>not to mention any other Consequences at present, I would only ask how rational Creatures could in any Case discover God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Will, by consulting the</em> Reason <em>of their own Minds? On this Supposition, no Duty whatever could possibly be found out without a</em> Revelation: <em>Since what has no Dependance on Reason and Truth, can never be investigable by any Understanding. So that this Notion, at the same time that it subverts</em> Morality, <em>plucks up</em> Natural Religion <em>by the Roots.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I add further, that as there could be no Duty, on this Supposition, without a Revelation; so a fresh Revelation would be requisite every Day, or rather every Hour. For if the Rule of Mens Duty was mere</em> Will, <em>and that</em> Will <em>variable, as it must be, if there</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>there</em> [<em>be</em>] | <em>be</em></span></span> <em>be nothing to fix it; it would be impossible for them to conclude from their present Duty, what their Obligations would be in any Point of Futurity.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short; nothing seems plainer to me, than that the supreme Agent, at all Times, and in all Cases that admit of it, acts by</em> Rule; <em>and that this Rule is no other than his own sacred, eternal, and necessary</em> Truth<em>.

WHATEVER Defects or Depravations may be ascribed to <em>Reason</em>, considered as a <em>Faculty</em> in Man; yet in its <em>objective</em> Acceptation, as it signifies the <em>Rule</em> of <em>Rectitude</em>, the eternal Reasons and Relations of Things; I see not, how it can ever be too much exalted, or admired.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In like manner, whatever Inconveniencies maybe objected to <em>Revelation</em>, or Blemishes found in it, as some of its Professors have managed and modelled it; yet considered in it self, abstracted from all Abuses and Adulterations; it <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">it [tends] | tends</span></span> tends to such excellent Purposes, affords such effectual Means, and is so wonderfully adapted to the Exigencies and Infirmities of our present State; that we can never be too tenacious of it, or thankful for it.

<strong>If</strong> this be a true Account of these two Divine Principles; who can avoid being deeply concerned, to find them either represented as at Variance, or set up in Opposition to each other? If there was any real Repugnance, or Inconsistence between them; such a Proceeding might naturally be expected. But if the Case be quite otherwise, as I doubt not but it is; must it not be a painful Consideration, to reflect, that Mens Minds would be thus divided between them, and drawn, as it were, into Parties; magnifying and diminishing both in their Turns; even so far, as to confine all Obligation to the one, and deny it wholly in respect of the other?

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>To</strong> aim at the Subversion of <em>Revealed Religion</em>, in order to promote the Credit and Authority of either <em>Natural Religion</em>, or <em>Morality</em>; seems to me like pulling down a noble and beautiful Structure, merely to lay open the Strength of its Foundations.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;On the other hand, to propose the Establishment or Advancement of <em>Revelation</em>, by weakning [sic] the Obligations of <em>Reason</em> and Morality; ap<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">ap- [pears] | pears</span></span>pears to me just such an Undertaking as it Would be to undermine a Fabrick, with a View to support and strengthen it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Into neither of these Schemes can I ever enter. Not into the former; because tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Rule of <em>Reason</em>, or System of <em>Moral Truth</em>, be absolutely perfect in itself, and therefore incapable of any Amendments; yet in respect of the corrupt and degenerate State of Mankind, many additional Helps are wanting; fresh Lights, subordinate Rules, preparatory Methods, and proper Encouragements, to direct, support, and fix Men in their Duty. Not in to the latter, because no <em>Religion</em>, whether <em>Natural</em> or <em>Revealed</em>, can possibly stand secure on any other Foundation, than that of <em>Reason</em> and <em>Truth</em>, as will afterwards be more, particularly shewn.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> seems therefore to be an useful, or rather necessary Work, to endeavour, I will not say to promote an Union between <em>Reason</em> and <em>Revelation</em>, for that is needless; but to shew that they actually are united, and at perfect Amity with each other; to point out the entire Agreement between them, and, by consequence, to draw the Friends of Either to the Interest of Both. Whatever promotes the Cause of Revealed Religion, befriends Morality, and whatever strengthens Morality, adds Force to Religion.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>I</strong> observe, not without Surprize, some Authors of great Merit and Distinction, acknowledging indeed the <em>Rule of Truth</em>, considered <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">considered [as] | as</span></span> as a <em>Rule</em>, but denying it at the same time to be properly a <em>Law</em> to any Rational Beings. That is, they look upon it as a Rule not really <em>obligatory</em>, but merely <em>directive</em>. And if this be the Truth of the Case, I verily think there neither is, nor can be, any such thing in Nature as either <em>Moral</em>, or <em>Religious Obligation</em>, properly so called. If <em>Truth</em> and <em>Reason</em> do not of themselves <em>oblige</em> moral Agents; as far as I am able to discover, nothing else can.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Towards clearing this Matter, and answering the forementioned Intention, I shall briefly endeavour to make out these three Points.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>First</em>, that Reason binds or <em>obliges</em>, in the strictest Sense of the Word, all Moral Agents.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Secondly</em>, that considering Men in that Capacity, the Obligations of <em>Religion</em> depend on the Obligations of Reason, and are wholly founded thereupon.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Thirdly</em>, that Religion, whether <em>Natural</em> or <em>Revealed</em>, stands very firmly and securely on this Ground. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
1. <strong>In</strong> order to discover whether, and how far, Reason <em>obliges</em> Moral Agents; it will be previously necessary to fix the Idea of <em>Obligation</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Whatever be the true Idea of it, most certainly it is different from that of <em>Compulsion</em>. It must be somewhat perfectly consistent with <em>Natural Liberty</em>. Whatever Obligations a Man may lie under; he is evidently as free to determine his own Actions, as if he lay under none at all. And indeed his Power of Self-determination, being a <em>physical Power</em>, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Power</em>, [cannot] | cannot</span></span> cannot possibly be destroyed or diminished by any <em>Reasons</em> or Considerations whatever. They may induce, incline, or persuade; but since they have no natural Efficiency, they cannot offer the least Violence to the Agent. There is no Danger therefore of confounding the Ideas of Obligation and Compulsion.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;On the other hand, it is equally evident, that all Obligations affect the Mind more or less, and in some measure alter the State of it. For since they are intirely of a relative Nature; relative, I mean, to the Mind of the Agent; and subsist no where else; it plainly follows, that the Mind must be affected by them, and cannot be in the same State with, or without them. We are therefore to consider how they affect the Mind, and what Change is produced in it; either in respect of its <em>active</em> or <em>passive</em> Powers. The <em>passive</em> Powers are summed up in <em>Intelligence</em> and <em>Sensibility</em>; in respect of which, the Mind appears, if I mistake not, susceptible of distinct Obligations. The <em>active</em> Power, or <em>Will</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> uncompelled, as we have already seen; yet is affected in both Kinds; as being naturally moved and excited by every Appearance of Good.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to proceed; the Mind, as <em>Sensible</em>, perceives and enjoys <em>Pleasure</em>, or Natural Good; which being found upon Trial essentially grateful thereto; cannot fail to recommend it self. Therefore it is necessarily liked when present, and desired when absent. <em>Pain</em>, or Natural Evil, is the Reverse; and by Consequence is <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">is [neces-] | necessarily</span></span> necessarily disliked, and shunned. The Mind cannot possibly approve Pain, or disapprove Pleasure, in themselves. It has indeed a natural Power of submitting to the former, and rejecting the latter; and accordingly, on certain Occasions, does both. Nevertheless, in their own Nature, both Objects are fixed and unchangeable, the one unavoidably agreeable, and the other odious.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Conscious of this, the Mind plainly and perpetually perceives a <em>Reason</em>, a <em>Motive</em>, or whatever you will call it, for its Pursuit of <em>Pleasure</em>, and Aversion from <em>Pain</em>. This <em>Perception</em> naturally moves and excites the Will; and thereby brings the Mind of the Agent into that State, that Disposition to act, wherein, I presume, <em>Obligation</em> consists. And forasmuch as the Reason or Motive, in this Case, is <em>external</em>; and directly concerns only the <em>Sensible</em> Part of his Nature; therefore I term this kind of <em>Obligation external</em>, or <em>Sensible</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be strictly proper to say, as doubtless it is, that Man is <em>obliged</em> to promote his own Interest, Happiness, or Natural Good; the Term must, I think, he understood as here explained; nor do I see how it can admit of any other Meaning. On the other hand, the Thing it self is very plain and clear; however it may be denominated or distinguished. Such a Motive perceived, must affect and influence the Agent in a certain manner, and bring his Mind into a State distinct from all other States, whatever Name be given it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be alledged, that <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">that [according] | according</span></span> according to this Account, Man is obliged to pursue every Object of Sensible Good which appears before him; I answer that it does by no means follow; but it would follow, and be certainly true; if no Superior Obligation intervened to hinder it. Any particular Gratification may be inconsistent with a Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s general Interest; and thereby over-ruled; not yet to mention other Obligations of a still higher Nature.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Again</strong>; the Mind as <em>intelligent</em> perceives <em>Truth</em>, or the necessary <em>Relations</em> of Things. More particularly the <em>Relations</em> subsisting between <em>Mind and Mind</em> constitute what we call <em>Moral Truth</em>. And as clearly to perceive and apprehend these Relations, is real Knowledge; so to act conformably to them is true or right Practice. This <em>Rectitude</em> of Action every Understanding necessarily approves; as being essentially <em>good</em>, and <em>self-eligible</em>. And the more regular and perfect the Mind of any Agent is; the higher his Approbation rises, and the more he is charmed with the Excellence thereof. Though Men are very imperfect and corrupt; and tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they have Liberty, or a natural Power of determining and acting in Opposition to Truth; yet nevertheless they cannot avoid approving this <em>Moral Fitness</em>, or Rectitude of Action. All Deviations from it they are sure to condemn in Others; and, sooner or later, even in themselves.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Here then is a Reason, an internal Reason, plainly perceived, for acting agree<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">agree- [ably] | ably</span></span>ably to so just and amiable a Rule. Being intrinsically right, and fit, and worthy of every Agent<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Choice; it naturally affects his Mind, and moves his Will to a suitable Compliance. This State of Mind produced by the Perception of such a Reason for Action, is, as I apprehend, the true Idea of <em>Moral Obligation</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> it be asked, what is our <em>Motive</em>, our Inducement to observe the <em>Rule of Reason and Truth</em>; I answer, <em>Itself.</em> It is <em>absolute and essential Good</em>, and therefore an Object of the purest Affection in the World. We pursue Natural Good, because it is <em>good for us</em>; and Moral Good, because it is <em>good in it self</em>. If an Affection for the former be necessary, so is an Affection for the latter; at least, in all undepraved Minds. And to ask, why a Man chuses and pursues the Object of his Affection; is a Question equally needless and absurd: And still more so, when the Object is supremely amiable. As <em>Pleasure</em> is the proper Object and ultimate End of <em>Sensible</em> Agents; so are Truth and Rectitude of <em>intelligent</em> and <em>moral</em> Agents. But to suppose Pleasure, or Natural Good, the ultimate End of any Agent, considered in his intellectual and moral Capacity, is to confound the Ideas of <em>Rectitude</em> and <em>Utility</em>, and to transfer Objects from one Faculty to another; it is to make <em>Truth</em> and <em>Virtue</em> ministerial to <em>Pleasure</em>, and the <em>Glory of God</em> subordinate to the <em>Convenience</em> and <em>Benefit</em> of His Creatures.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Creatures. [<strong>Confor</strong>-] | <strong>Conformity</strong></span></span>
<strong>Conformity</strong> to Reason and Truth is not only <em>relatively</em>, but <em>absolutely</em> fit; not only fit to promote Happiness; but originally, essentially, and necessarily fit. For why must this Term be confined to a <em>relative</em> Signification, any more than the <em>&aelig;quum</em> and <em>rectum</em> of the Antients? However, instead of <em>Fitness</em>, let <em>Rectitude</em> be used; or any other Word of an absolute Signification. It is not the Word, but the Thing, for which I contend.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And surely <em>right</em> Action, and <em>profitable</em> Action, are very distinct: Ideas; whatever Coincidence may be found between them. The former would still have been <em>Moral Good</em>; would still have engaged the Understanding, and attracted the Will, even supposing the Wisdom and Goodness of God had not annexed to it <em>natural Good</em>. It is very true that Pleasure accompanies and follows Virtue, both by Nature, and by Divine Appointment; but yet whoever pursues Virtue solely or chiefly with a View to that Pleasure, diminishes both. The purest Pleasure, and noblest Satisfaction in the World, spring from the doing of <em>right</em> Actions, because they are right: That is, from a disinterested Love of Truth and Rectitude.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Concerning</strong> the Eligibility of this excellent Object, I have already observed, that it must and will speak for it self. There is no other way of proving either natural or moral Good; than by referring every Man to his own Perceptions. Thither the Appeal must lie, in both Cases; and every Percipient judge <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">judge [for] | for</span></span> for himself. And as the Perception of <em>natural Good</em> may be ostructed [sic] by various Distemperatures of Body, or Mind; so the Perception of <em>moral Good</em> may be hindered or impaired by Inattention, Prejudice, or Vice. Otherwise it cannot fail to recommend itself in the fullest manner; as being, in its own Nature, peculiarly amiable, and choice-worthy.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Again; if, this being admitted, it be nevertheless inquired, why, excluding the Obligations of Religion, a Man may not, in any Instance, as innocently reject <em>Moral Good</em>, as <em>Natural</em>; and counteract <em>Reason</em> as Well as forego <em>Pleasure</em>; the Answer is, that a lesser Obligation is null and void in course, when ever it interferes with a greater. When a good Reason of any kind, appears for the Rejection of any particular Pleasure; it may not only be rejected innocently, but laudably. In so doing, the Agent only quits an inferior, to follow a superior Obligation. But no Rule, no Law, no Authority in the World, can controul, or cancel a Moral Duty. The Obligation of Truth and Reason is supreme; therefore it gives way to nothing, and ever remains inviolable.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>That</strong> Virtue stands in need of being supported and encouraged, in such a World as this, and among such Creatures as Men; is certainly and notoriously true; and if there be any who think otherwise; they must either be very inconsiderate, or strongly prejudiced. But this is not the Point before us. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">us. [We] | We</span></span> We are not inquiring after the Wants, Defects, and Imperfections of <em>Human Nature</em>; but into the Perfection and Excellence of <em>Virtue</em> itself. And considered in this Light, it is abundantly self-supported; nor can any Recommendations equal its own. It intrinsically deserves, that all Rational Beings submit to it, and be governed by it. As every <em>Understanding</em> worships it; so every <em>Will</em> ought to fall down before it. To refuse Subjection to right Reason, when clearly seen and known; may be looked upon as the very Essence of Rebellion. It is violating the great and fundamental Law of Heaven and Earth. It is striking at the Foundation of all Authority whatever, as will be shewn afterwards. Even the Throne of God rests upon it; and his Prerogative is supported by it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short; <em>Reason</em>, objectively considered, is not only amiable, but venerable, sacred, and divine. It is not only the Rule, the sole Rule of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s own Actions which would render it sacred, if it were not so in itself; but moreover it is <em>Divine</em>, in the strictest Sense: All necessary Truth being an essential Efflux or Emanation from the infinite and all perfect Mind. Hence it appears not only possessed of the highest Worth, Beauty and Excellence, but invested with a supreme and absolute Authority, not only attractive, but really awful. Of which no other Account can, I think, be given; than the Divineness of the Object. Every Ray of Truth and Reason seems to par<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">par- [ticipate] | ticipate</span></span>ticipate of the Majesty of that Being; to whom it all belongs, and whose Attribute it is.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If this be thought carrying on the Matter too far, even into the Borders of Enthusiasm; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> I cannot be of that Mind, I am content to retreat to my former Ground. What I insist upon is, that Moral Truth and Rectitude are Self-good, and Self-eligible; influencing the Minds and attracting the Wills of all Moral Agents; and thereby bringing them in to a State of <em>Obligation</em>. If this be not the true Idea of Obligation, I shall be glad to learn what is. In the mean time let us suppose it to be so, and see what follows from it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> then the Rule of Truth be thus sacred, thus absolutely and essentially good; it must be, in the foregoing Sense of the Word, of universal <em>Obligation</em>. For it must affect and influence all Minds, in proportion to their Perfection and Purity: From whence it follows, that it not only <em>directs</em>, but, strictly speaking, <em>obliges</em> the <em>Deity</em> himself. And not only so, but the Obligation of it must be infinitely stronger in respect of Him, than of any imperfect and created Agents. This, I humbly suppose, must be the Case; partly for the Reason above-mentioned, and partly because He comprehends the Whole of this sacred Rule, and views it in all its Glory.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be, as according to all our Ideas it must be, the best, and fittest, and noblest Rule, that a perfect Agent can follow; can we doubt either the Reality, or Sufficiency, of this very <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">very [Motive?] | Motive?</span></span> Motive? Among such frail Beings as we are, the strongest <em>Reasons</em> for Action are often but feeble <em>Motives</em>; which is chiefly to be ascribed to the Importunities of Sense, and the Usurpations of Appetite. But a Being infinitely pure and perfect, rational and righteous, regards nothing so readily, hears nothing so willingly as the Voice of Reason, and the Dictates of Truth. By these He is not only <em>directed</em>; but <em>induced</em>, and prevailed upon to act according to their Directions. They not only influence his holy Will; but are, I believe, his chief, if not his sole Motives. And this appears to me not only more probable than any other Supposition; but also more conducive to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Glory. For I am not able to conceive any thing so glorious, or God-like; as a perpetual Adherence to Truth, and ever acting righteously for Righteousness sake.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Besides; since all Moral Truths are really and strictly divine; His acting in Conformity thereto, is only acting in Conformity to Himself. And surely it can no way derogate from the Perfection of his Conduct, but very much the contrary; to suppose, that his <em>Will</em> is obliged and governed by his unerring <em>Understanding</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> it be argued, as indeed it is; that the Deity must be incapable of Obligation, because He has <em>no Superior to prescribe Laws to Him</em>; I beg it may be considered, that neither <em>Superiority</em>, nor Supremacy of <em>Power</em>, can confer any Right to Obedience. And as <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">as [to] | to</span></span> to a <em>Superiority</em> of <em>Wisdom</em> and <em>Goodness</em>; that indeed implies Authority, presupposing the <em>Obligations of Reason and Truth</em>; but not otherwise, as will immediately be shewn. Were it therefore possible to suppose that the Deity could have any Superior; no Obligation would follow from such a Supposition, but what actually is in full Force without it. For if <em>Reason</em> be <em>obligatory</em> in its own Nature; then it must <em>oblige</em> at first Hand, as well as at second; the supreme, as well as subordinate Agents; and that in Proportion to the Degree wherein it is possessed. On the contrary, if Reason be not thus obligatory, then it can neither oblige at first, nor at second Hand; neither the supreme, nor subordinate Agents. Since then the Deity is possessed of Reason and Truth in all possible Perfection, and to an Infinite Degree, I humbly conclude He must be infinitely <em>obliged</em> by it: Whereas, were He not supreme, his Perfections being finite, his Obligations would be so too. And as to that Regard and Honour which, on such a Supposition, would be due from Him to Another; they are equally due from Him to Himself. He is obliged to honour his own supreme Perfections, as much as He would be, supposing they belonged to another Agent. This I am more willing to observe, as it seems to me that the Glory of God, as intended and promoted by Himself, is generally misconceived; and often explained quite away. His glorifying Himself and his own Perfections, appears <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">appears [to] | to</span></span> to me not only a real distinct End; but the first and supreme; to which all other Ends are, and ought to be subordinate; and that in Conformity to Truth itself; which eternally requires, that every Being be considered and regarded, even by himself, according to the Perfections which he is really possessed of. And as Truth requires that God be infinitely self-honoured; so that Honour seems principally to consist in an inviolable Deference to Truth. By perpetually regarding and conforming to Truth, which is his own Attribute; He ever glorifies Himself; and indeed manifests at the same Time, both the infinite Perfection of his Understanding, and the absolute Rectitude of his Will.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to return; the foregoing Reasoning will perhaps appear in a clearer Light, when we have gone through the <em>second</em> Point; which I proposed to examine. 
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
2. <strong>Here</strong> then I must endeavour to shew, that considering Men in their intellectual and moral Capacity,<em> the Obligations of Religion depend, and are entirely founded on the Obligations of Reason</em>. Or in other Words, that Religion binds Men, as Moral Agents, only in Virtue of Truth and Reason.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;By <em>Religion</em> I mean Obedience to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Will and Commands, considered as such; whether the Reasons of them be known, or unknown. It is allowed on all Hands, that God hath an unquestionable Right to the Obedience of his Creatures. The Question therefore is, what is the Foundation <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Foundation [of] | of</span></span> of that Right; wherein religious Obligation Consists, or what it is that binds Men to obey the Will of God. As far as I am able to discover; God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority, and Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Obedience, must be founded on the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Benefits</em>; or the <em>Perfections</em> of his Nature; or the <em>Sanctions</em> annexed to his Laws. All the Grounds of Authority, and the Principles of Obedience, that I can think of, are here comprehended and included. Let us therefore consider them in the Order wherein I have mentioned them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Of</strong> God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Benefits</em>, Creation has been commonly reckoned the chief; but why, and on what Account, is hard to discover. For if it be considered abstractedly; it is so far from being the greatest Benefit, that it is really none at all. Nay, it might be looked upon as a Hardship, a Grievance, an Injury; if Creatures were placed in such Circumstances, as to have unavoidably more Evil in their Lot than Good. In Fact, this is not the Case, as we have just Reason to conclude, of any Creature in the Universe. And as to Man; he is so happily distinguished, and has such, and so many Blessings heaped upon him, that he neither knows how to number them, nor value them as he ought. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> therefore mere Existence cannot, in Strictness, be said to bring him under any Obligation; yet such an Existence, such a Condition as he is blessed with, cannot fail of binding him to Gratitude and Obedience. His Creator is to be considered by him, as his supreme and most bountiful Benefactor; and as such, to be loved, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">loved, [honoured,] | honoured,</span></span> honoured, reverenced and obeyed. I add <em>obeyed</em>, because it is essential to Gratitude, to endeavour to please a Benefactor, by acting agreeably to his Will.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But then it is to be considered, that no Benefits can give the Benefactor a Title to absolute and unconditional Obedience. If he be supposed to will or require any thing that is repugnant to <em>Truth</em>; the Obligations of Gratitude are so far nulled, or at least suspended; that, in such Instances, no Compliance is, or can be, due. I am very sensible our Divine Benefactor can never will any thing of this Kind. Nevertheless I judge the foregoing Observation not impertinent; as it points out the supreme and ultimate Obligation; and plainly shews, that nothing can bind in Opposition to Truth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Any further Limitation than this I absolutely deny. For supposing, but not granting, that God has given Men any Commands so intirely indifferent, as to have no Tendency, either Moral or Natural; I fear not to affirm, that they are indispensibly bound to observe them: Gratitude means nothing, if it do not oblige Men to Submission and Compliance in the Case here supposed. By obeying those Commands which visibly tend to Natural or Moral Good, Men may shew their Love of <em>Truth</em>, or their Love of <em>Themselves</em>; but where is their Gratitude towards <em>God</em>, if they slight his Will; merely because it is nothing but his Will? This is contrary to the established Ideas of Gratitude between Man and Man; much more of that Gra<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Gra- [titude] | titude</span></span>titude which is due to the Supreme Benefactor. Whether it be probable that God has actually given any such Commands; is another Point, and will more properly be considered in another Place. At present I shall only observe, that it is not to be doubted but such Commands have been given, as are <em>apparently</em>, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> not <em>really</em> of this Nature; and that with the utmost Propriety, Wisdom, and Goodness.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to proceed; this Principle of religious Obedience, whatever be the Extent of it, manifestly derives all its Force from <em>Reason</em> and <em>Truth</em>. As God is our kind Creator, and gracious Benefactor, we find ourselves bound in Gratitude studiously to fulfil his Will, and regard his good Pleasure. Very just, and right, and fit. But is not this plainly a necessary <em>Truth</em>; a <em>moral Fitness</em>, resulting from the immutable <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Relations</em> of Things? And must not this <em>Moral Fitness</em> be consequently allowed to oblige of itself, and in its own Nature, independently of all other Laws and Obligations? If such <em>Reasons</em> and <em>Truths</em> carry no Obligation along with them, according to the Opinion which I am opposing; what is that Principle founded on, which we have been considering; or what is there to support it? For how can Men be bound to obey God, in Virtue of such Reasons and Considerations, as are supposed to be altogether <em>unobligatory</em>, and without Force? On this Supposition, as far as I can perceive, Gratitude and Piety are empty Names, and mere Nullities.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;It has <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">has [been] | been</span></span> been alledged, that <em>Moral Fitnesses</em> oblige Men merely in Virtue of the <em>Divine Will</em>. To say back again, that the <em>Divine Will</em> obliges merely in Virtue of Truth and <em>Moral Fitness</em>, would be running into a shameful Circle. One of these Propositions must be false. If the latter; I flatter my self we are in a fair Way to discover it, and be convinced of it. As yet, I think, it has not appeared. On the contrary, it seems very evident, that whatever Strength there may be in the foregoing Principle, it is wholly owing to the intrinsick Obligations of Reason and Truth. Let us try Another.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Is</strong> then our religious Obedience founded on the Consideration of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Perfections</em>; more especially his infinite Wisdom and Goodness? Are we bound to obey Him on account of his being supremely and perfectly capable of governing the World; as He throughly [!!!] understands, and inflexibly adheres to Right and Truth, at all Times, and in all Cases; and as He fully comprehends the true Interest of all his Creatures, and perpetually promotes it? Such a Governor must have an unquestionable Right, an unrivalled Claim to universal Subjection and Obedience; if any Regard be due to <em>Truth</em> and <em>Reason</em>; which clearly exhibit it to the Minds, and loudly proclaim it in the Ears of all intelligent Creatures. But if <em>Truth</em> and <em>Reason</em> have no real <em>Authority</em>; if they cannot, of themselves, lay any <em>Obligation</em> on Moral Agents; then the foregoing Difficulty <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Difficulty [returns] | returns</span></span> returns upon us, and this <em>Righe</em> [!!!] likewise, strong and sacred as it is, appears without any visible Foundation. For if an <em>immediate</em> Submission to <em>Truth</em> be not strictly our Duty; a <em>mediate</em> one certainly cannot. If <em>Reason</em> and <em>Moral Fitness</em> bind us not; how can We be bound to obey God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Commands, merely on account of the <em>Rectitude</em> of his Will, and the <em>Wisdom</em> of his Government? Can there be any Weight in that Authority, which is derived from a Principle of no Force, and void of all Obligation? If Homage and Subjection be ever due to the supreme Legislator, because he governs the World by the eternal <em>Rule of Truth and Righteousness</em>; must not that <em>Rule</em> be the original <em>Law</em>, as well as the Basis of all <em>Authority?</em> In short, to maintain that Obedience is due to God, because his <em>Law is the Truth</em>; and to deny at the same Time the <em>Obligation</em> of <em>Truth</em>; appears to me such an Inconsistence, as can never be cleared up. To found <em>Religion</em> on <em>Truth</em>, is to found it on a <em>Rock</em>; if Truth be sacred and obligatory in its own Nature: but if not; it is building Religion on <em>Sand</em>, and supporting it with a <em>broken Reed</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Perhaps this Conclusion may be thought too hastily drawn; as one of the forementioned Principles yet remains to be examined.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Though</strong> therefore right <em>Reason</em>, <em>Truth</em> and <em>Fitness</em>, be supposed incapable of <em>obliging</em> Men; and, by Consequence, of upholding Religion; yet may not this be really and effec<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">effec- [tually] | tually</span></span>tually done by the <em>Sanctions</em> annexed to the Divine Laws? If <em>Truth</em> cannot bind Men; does it follow that <em>Power</em> cannot?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That the <em>Sanctions</em> of Religion do really bind and <em>oblige</em> Men, I readily grant; but how, and in what Capacity? Not in their <em>Moral</em>, but <em>Sensible</em> Capacity. I have already acknowledged, and maintained, That, considered as <em>Sensible Agents</em>, Men are actually <em>obliged</em> to seek <em>Natural Good</em>, and avoid <em>Natural Evil</em>; the one being a necessary Object of Desire, the other of Aversion. But what has this to do with <em>Moral Obligation?</em> Can the <em>Sanctions</em> of Religion, or any <em>Sensible</em> Motives, bind the <em>Consciences</em> of Men, or take any hold of them? They are very proper to work on our <em>Hopes</em> and <em>Fears</em>; and even necessary for the Government of such degenerate Creatures as we are: but, I presume, they have no more Concern with <em>Conscience</em>, than <em>Truth</em> has with <em>Sense</em>. That can only be affected by <em>internal Reasons</em>; which would bind <em>Moral Agents</em>, even tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they were void of <em>Sensibility</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>When</strong> the Apostle is pressing <em>Subjection to the Higher Powers</em>; can we suppose that he means by <em>Wrath</em>, and <em>Conscience</em>, one and the same Principle? Is it not evident, that he considers them as <em>distinct Obligations?</em> And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> he be speaking, not of the Supreme and Divine <em>Ruler</em>, but of subordinate and human ones; that makes no Difference in the present Argument, but what is in Favour of it. It holds true, <em>&agrave; fortiori</em>, that we <em>must needs be</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>be</em> [<em>subject</em>] | <em>subject</em></span></span> <em>subject</em> to the Supreme Ruler, <em>not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake</em>. We are required to obey Human Authority; not only with a View to avoid the Pains and Penalties of the Law; but also, and chiefly, from a conscientious Regard to Divine Authority. In like manner, we are to obey <em>God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority</em>, not merely with a View to the <em>Sanctions</em> annexed to his Laws; but also, and chiefly, from a conscientious Regard to <em>Truth</em>, <em>Reason</em>, and <em>Rectitude</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Nothing</strong> therefore is plainer, than that the Obligations of <em>Conscience</em> ought not to be confounded with those which arise from the <em>Punishments</em> denounced against Disobedience. The former, however distinct, are indeed implied in the latter. For as Punishment necessarily implies Guilt; so Guilt necessarily implies a Breach or some antecedent Obligation. No Man can deserve either well, or ill, otherwise than by discharging or violating the Obligations incumbent on him. These therefore are necessarily presupposed in the Sanctions themselves; which otherwise could neither be justified, nor understood. In a Moral Sense, Obedience to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority is equally a Duty, with them, or without them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If God had annexed no Sanctions to his Laws; will any Man say they might have been innocently transgressed? Whoever asserts this, must maintain, that all <em>Authority</em> and <em>Dominion</em> are founded in <em>Power:</em> The Consequence of which must be, that Tyrants and Usurpers, <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Usurpers, [Pyrates] | Pyrates</span></span> Pyrates and Robbers, have a Right to every Thing they lay their Hands on. I beg leave to add, That if the Author of the <em>Leviathan</em> really believed this Principle, as he professed and taught it; he must, I think, have laboured under the greatest Confusion of Ideas that ever befel any Understanding.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return: How shall we get clear of the Difficulty before us? If the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority over his Creatures be not founded on <em>Power</em>; it must be founded on <em>Right</em>. And if it be founded on <em>Right</em>, must not that Right be valid and binding in and from itself? If that which constitutes the Authority, be, in its own Nature, unobligatory; must not the Authority be so too? But since God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority is out of the Question; we must either acknowledge the Force and Validity of that Principle, for which I am contending; or find out some other Grounds for the Obligations of Religion. How this may be done, is, I confess, beyond my Comprehension.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> it be said, that without any Regard to the <em>Rule of Reason</em>, and the <em>Law of Truth</em>, the <em>Will</em> of God is obligatory in its own Nature, and from its own Perfection; I have already observed, That a perfect Will ungoverned by Reason, and undirected by Truth, is an inconsistent and repugnant Idea; forasmuch as a Will self-guided, and self-governed, argues the greatest Imperfection, and can only belong to the most arbitrary Agents. Such a <em>Will</em> supported by <em>Power</em>, is the very Idea of <em>Ty</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Ty</em>- [<em>ranny</em>;] | <em>ranny</em>;</span></span><em>ranny</em>; and by Consequence diametrically opposite to the Perfections of the Deity. No Agent can be <em>obliged</em> by such a <em>Will</em>, to any thing further, than providing for his own Safety, and guarding, as well as he can, against the mischievous Effects of it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>In</strong> short: If <em>Morality</em> be not the Basis of <em>Religion</em>, and <em>Truth</em> the Basis of <em>Morality</em>; I am not able to frame any Idea of <em>Obligation</em>, either religious or moral. To resolve both ultimately into the <em>Will</em> of God; seems to me inverting the Natures of Things, and turning their very Essences upside down. It is to represent <em>Understanding</em> as governed by <em>Will</em>, instead of Will governed by Understanding: from whence it would follow, that Virtue and Religion were absolutely precarious, and changeable at Pleasure. On the contrary, I have endeavoured to shew, that <em>Truth</em> must oblige independently of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Will</em>; and not God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Will</em> independently on <em>Truth</em>. Securely may it be affirmed, that if it were possible for Him to will that <em>Treachery</em> and <em>Ingratitude</em> should become our Duty, instead of <em>Gratitude</em> and <em>Fidelity</em>; such a Will would be unobligatory and void; which it could never be in any Case, or upon any Supposition, if all Obligation depended ultimately on his Will. On the other hand, should it be supposed that God was pleased to suspend his <em>Authority</em> for a certain Term, and leave every Thing to its own Nature; will any Man say, that during this supposed Term, <em>Gratitude</em> and <em>Ingrati</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Ingrati</em>- [<em>tude</em>,] | <em>tude</em>,</span></span><em>tude</em>, <em>Fidelity</em>, and <em>Treachery</em>, would be of equal Worth, and equal Obligation? As well might he identify <em>Pain</em> and <em>Pleasure</em>, <em>Light</em> and <em>Darkness</em>. From these Suppositions, impossible as they are, it plainly appears, that <em>Truth</em> obliges not in Virtue of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Authority</em>; but <em>God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority</em> in Virtue of <em>Truth</em>; which is therefore the real Ground of all religious Obligation.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
3. <strong>The</strong> <em>Third</em> Point to be proved, is, that, <em>on this Ground, Religion, whether Natural or Revealed, stands very firm and secure</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But how and wherein <em>secure?</em> Will <em>Religion</em> work its way, and prevail every where, merely by the Influence of <em>Reason</em>, and the Power of <em>Truth?</em> Is it likely, without any other Recommendation or Enforcement, to meet with a general Reception among Mankind? I have already acknowledged the contrary. However sufficient <em>Truth</em> may be for maintaining its own Authority, and that of <em>Religion</em>, among superior Beings, and in <em>other</em> Worlds; it is not pretended to be so in <em>this</em>. The Fierceness and Headiness of Mankind will not ordinarily be restrained by the mild Laws, and pure Dictates of <em>Reason</em>. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> they are <em>rational</em> Creatures; yet they are corrupt and degenerate. Their Appetites are too strong, and their Passions too furious, to be managed and held in by any intellectual Reins.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>This</strong>, and much more, is confessedly true. But what follows? Nothing but what will as readily be admitted. I mean, that the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [<em>Sanctions</em>] | <em>Sanctions</em></span></span> <em>Sanctions</em> of Religion are very proper, and even necessary, for the Support of Virtue, and the Maintenance of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority among Men. But because the Bonds of Truth alone are seldom sufficient to hold us; are they therefore to be taken quite away? Are the Obligations of Reason to be looked upon as mere Cobwebs; because we are such wild Creatures as to break through them every Moment? By this Rule, not only the <em>internal</em>, but even the <em>external</em> Obligations of Religion must be excluded, and pronounced void. No Sanctions, whether natural or positive, have hitherto proved generally effectual. Both are neglected, and counteracted continually; and, in all Probability, will be so; till the Corruptions of Human Nature be remedied, and a Reformation accomplished. No Conclusion therefore can be drawn from hence, against either the Reality, or Validity of those Obligations which I have been considering.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Let</strong> us then go on to inquire, what Idea we can have of <em>Religion</em>, supposing its whole Force to consist in its <em>Sanctions</em>; and that it carried no Obligation with it, but what was derived from thence. Even <em>Revealed Religion</em>, notwithstanding the Weight, Awfulness, and Solemnity of its Sanctions; would, on this Supposition, appear to great Disadvantage. It would be little more, I presume, than a <em>Bond of Indemnity</em>, and a mere <em>Contract of Interest</em>. If Christians disclaim and <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">and [disavow] | disavow</span></span> disavow all Reasons for Well-doing, all Grounds of Obedience, besides those of their own Safety and Advantage; how will they avoid incurring the Imputations of <em>mercenary Obedience</em>, and bought Piety? And is this consulting the Honour of God, and maintaining the Dignity of Religion? Can it ever nourish, or produce Fruits worthy of it; while it is grafted entirely on <em>Sensibility</em> and <em>Selfishness?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I have elsewhere contended earnestly in Behalf of these religious Motives; and shall ever be ready to do it again; but to lay all this Stress on them, and magnify them at the Expence of Religion itself; appears one of those Extremes which I shall ever industriously shun.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let Religion by all means be attended with these Sanctions, and supported by them; but let not these Sanctions be made to justle out Religion, and placed in its Stead. Let it be guarded and strengthened by them; but not degraded.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> seems to me most evident, that we ought to <em>obey</em> God, as well as <em>worship</em> Him, <em>in Spirit and Truth</em>. Chiefly, I mean from a Sense of <em>Spiritual Obligations</em>, and a Consciousness of the <em>Truth</em> and <em>Fitness</em> of such a Behaviour. This is honouring both Him, and Religion, much more than could be done by mere stipulated Obedience.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To reject indeed, and depredate the Rewards of Religion; to profess a Contempt of them, and represent them as useless or needless, must, I think, be great Folly, or great Affectation. Even Truth re<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">re- [quires] | quires</span></span>quires that we regard them in Proportion to their real Worth. But it neither requires, nor allows us to be wholly influenced by them. It will not suffer us to discard the <em>Moral Principle</em>, in order to give them the full Possession of our Minds. On the contrary, <em>that Obligation</em> is ever to be acknowledged <em>Supreme</em>; and regarded and reverenced accordingly. The Question is not, which Principle is, in Fact, more prevalent and successful among frail Men; but which is, in itself, more pure and perfect, more generous and divine. However Men may want to be encouraged, or awed, by Rewards and Punishments; which is more especially their Case under Difficulties and Temptations; still it must be owned, that the more <em>conscientious</em> and <em>disinterested</em> their Obedience is; the more acceptable it must be to God, and more worthy in itself.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>This</strong> <em>internal Obligation</em> is indeed the Life and Soul of all Religion. To obey God from a Love of <em>Truth</em>, and a Principle of <em>Rectitude</em> is the Perfection of Obedience, and the very <em>Religion</em> of <em>Angels</em>. <em>Ours</em> too it must be, if we aspire to any Resemblance of their Purity. Whatever be our Religion; it surely concerns us to take heed, that we do not <em>maim</em> and deform it; by striking at those Principles, which are the <em>Sinews</em> of all Virtue and Goodness. I should rather have said, that we do not <em>murder</em> it; by reaching a Wound into its very <em>Vitals</em>. For this indeed <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">indeed [is] | is</span></span> is the Case. If the <em>Obligations</em> of <em>Truth</em> and <em>Reason</em> be once dissolved; <em>Religion</em> must languish, and die in course. The true <em>Power</em> of it is gone; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the <em>Form</em> remains. Instead of a living Principle, it becomes a breathless Carcase; or rather a mere Machine; moved by Springs, and actuated by inferior Affections.

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Let</strong> it not be supposed that this Doctrine tends to the Diminution of those <em>Motives</em>, which are justly reckoned among the peculiar Blessings of <em>Christianity</em>. For as nothing of this kind is intended; so nothing here said will fairly admit of any such Construction. That Christianity has greatly befriended Mankind by heightning [sic] and ascertaining the Motives of Religion, is undeniably true: and it is equally true, that the World stood in great need of such Helps. But does it follow from hence, that the <em>Glory of God</em>, or, in other Words, the Establishment of Truth and Righteousness, is not our <em>supreme End?</em> Because the highest and noblest Rewards are proposed to the Obedient; does it follow that they constitute the sole Principle of Obedience, and that we are under no Obligation but what arises from thence? Can it be supposed, that Christians are to be thus gloriously recompensed, merely for aiming at a Recompence, without Regard to any thing else? If this can be maintained; then indeed the foregoing Doctrine must be erroneous. But, if I mistake not, such a supposition is not only repugnant <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">repugnant [to] | to</span></span> to Reason; but inconsistent with every Page of the Gospel. There Men are taught, not to <em>glorify God</em> in Subservience to their own <em>Interest</em>; but to pursue their own <em>Interest</em> in Subordination to <em>God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Glory</em>. This their <em>ultimate End</em>; this their direct Aim; all other Views <em>collateral</em>. There Rewards are propounded to Christians; not for seeking Rewards, and consulting their own Advantage; but for <em>Well-doing</em>; that is, without Question, for discharging the Obligations of Virtue and Religion, antecedently incumbent on them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In fine, the Sanctions of Religion are not Religion; neither are Tyes of Interest moral Obligations. Such Motives are fit <em>Helps</em>, and useful <em>Appendages</em>; but Truth and Rectitude are the very <em>Essence</em> of Religion. Whether then its Credit, Security, and Establishment, are more likely to be promoted by the Doctrine here taught, or the contrary; let the Reader judge.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> in order to gain further Light concerning this Matter; it may be proper to subjoin a few more Observations touching both <em>Natural</em> and <em>Revealed Religion</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;By <em>Natural Religion</em> I understand the Practice of Truth and Righteousness in Obedience to the Will of God. The Opposers of Revelation ordinarily confound this Idea with that of <em>Moral Virtue</em>. Which, in them, is the more to be wondered at; as they profess such a rigorous Adherence to clear and distinct Ideas. And can any Ideas be more distinct, than act<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">act- [ing] | ing</span></span>ing in direct <em>Conformity to Truth</em>, and acting in Obedience to <em>God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority?</em> However the <em>Actions</em> may coincide; these <em>Principles</em> of Action cannot possibly be the same. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Authority</em> be ultimately founded on <em>Truth</em>, and his Will ever obliges in virtue of Truth; yet surely this is no Proof of Identity. <em>Moral</em> Duties flow <em>immediately</em> and <em>primarily</em> from Truth and Reason; <em>religious</em> Duties <em>mediately</em> and <em>secondarily</em>. These depend <em>immediately</em> on the supreme <em>Will</em>. And tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> even this Will could not bind in Opposition to Reason; yet it may and does bind in Cases where Reason is silent. Silent, I mean, as to the Precepts themselves; tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> at the same Time loudly proclaiming the Authority of the Legislator. But this belongs to <em>revealed Religion</em>. I only mention it here to shew, that tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Ground of Morality and Religion be ultimately the same; yet they must be nevertheless distinct Principles of Action.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Do we not accordingly find, in Fact, that Actions morally good may be performed on either of these Principles? That is, either in direct Obedience to the <em>Law of Truth</em>; or the <em>God of Truth</em>. Nay, it is manifest that the Agent may actually propose both Intentions in one and the same Action.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to proceed; however <em>Morality</em> and <em>natural Religion</em> may be distinguished; most certain it is, that they are strongly and indissolubly connected. A Being of infinite Perfection must necessarily approve what is <em>right</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>right</em> [and] | and</span></span> and <em>fit</em>; and disapprove the contrary. Whatever therefore is evidently conformable to Truth and Fitness, must be agreeable to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Will: and, by Consequence, whatever is <em>morally Good</em>, must be a Precept of <em>natural Religion</em>. On the other hand, every Precept of natural Religion must be morally good; forasmuch as, without Revelation, the <em>Will</em> of God is only discoverable by <em>moral Goodness</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;The Validity and Authority of <em>Religion</em> can never be shaken, while <em>Reason</em> has really any Force to bind Men; because <em>Reason</em> eternally requires all Obedience to the <em>Divine</em> Will, as well as Conformity to itself. But if the <em>Obligations of Reason</em> are disowned; and looked upon as mere Philosophical Fancies, and abstract Shadows; I see not, for my Part, how any Religion can be valid. Eternal Force it may have, to work on Mens <em>Affections</em>; but internal Power for binding their Consciences, it can have none; as, I think, has been sufficiently proved.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>As</strong> <em>Morality</em> supports all true <em>Religion</em>, so all true <em>Religion</em> aids and strengthens <em>M</em>orality. <em>Virtue</em>, in Conjunction with <em>Religion</em>, even <em>natural Religion</em>, is much more forcible than alone. Not only in respect of its <em>Sanctions</em>; which with Men, indeed, are apt to have the greatest Weight; but as the <em>internal Principle</em> is greatly enforced. The Streams of Virtue and Religion, by being united in the same Channel, become larger and more vigorous: better able to surmount Difficulties, and bear <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">bear [down] | down</span></span> down Temptations. When the <em>Reasonableness</em> of an Action cannot prevail. <em>Religion</em> comes seasonably in to the Agent<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Relief; presents to his Mind his All-righteous Governour, and most bounteous Benefactor; and draws with all the Cords of Gratitude and Piety. When executing the Dictates of Reason and Truth appear less engaging, and desirable; he finds, in fulfilling his Maker<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Will, new Charms, and fresh Attractions.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If <em>Virtue</em> cannot strike and subdue the Heart of Man in her own native Dress, her own amiable Colours; she Willingly assumes a more aweful Garb, [???] and puts on the Robe of <em>Religion</em>. Thus arrayed both in Sweetness and Majesty; she conquers with more Ease, and captivates with greater Success. Not that true Religion ever disguises Virtue. It neither changes her Complexion, nor alters a Feature. These are the odious Works of <em>Imposture</em> and <em>Superstition</em>. All that <em>Religion</em> means, is to place <em>Virtue</em> in a stronger Light, and give her a more solemn Appearance. Even its <em>Sanctions</em> are only <em>Guards</em>; intended for Security and Dignity; and the gaining of those grosser Minds, who are less sensible of the intrinsick Excellence of Virtue and Religion.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In short; <em>Conformity to Truth</em> and <em>Obedience to Divine Authority</em>; [???] whether considered separately or jointly; are Principles so sacred and sublime; that a Capacity to be acted and governed by them;[???] is the highest Honour which can possibly belong either to Men or Angels.

<strong>Several</strong> of the preceding Observations relating to Religion in general, must be applicable to that which is <em>Revealed</em>, as well as that which is <em>Natural</em>. But <em>Revealed Religion</em> having divers Peculiarities of its own, requires a distinct Consideration. It is not my Intention to go through such Particulars; which is far beyond, if not beside my present Purpose. For that it will be sufficient, to shew that those additional Laws which Revealed Religion has built on Natural, stand perfectly secure on the forementioned Ground. If the Christian Religion really contained any <em>Doctrines</em>, or <em>Duties</em>, inconsistent with <em>Truth</em> and <em>Rectitude</em>; then, indeed, it would follow, that there must be some Fault, either in the Foundation, or the Superstructure. But of this Kind, I have not yet met with any Thing fairly proved. No real Flaws or Blemishes, have I been able to discover; whatever may have been fancied in it, or thrown upon it, by Ignorance, Prejudice, Disaffection, or Corruption. I deny not but the <em>Face of Christianity</em> may have been seen overspread, with thick <em>Dust</em> from one Quarter; vile <em>Paint</em> from another; and Heaps of <em>Dirt</em> from a third: but when these shall be throughly [sic] washed off, its native Beauty will soon return, and <em>appear without Spot, or Wrinkle, or any such Thing</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Those</strong> Duties which <em>Revealed Religion</em> has superadded to <em>Natural</em>, may be considered as instrumental, subsidiary, and subordinate. Either they have a <em>visible Tendency</em> to promote <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">promote [moral,] | moral,</span></span> moral, or natural Good; or an <em>invisible</em> one. For as to such Precepts as are totally <em>positive</em>, and strictly <em>indifferent</em>; I find no sufficient Grounds to conclude that any such have ever been enjoined. For as to the Trial of Mens Obedience; I see not how it can ever require such Injunctions: since Men may be as effectually tried without them. Their Obedience is as much shewn in submitting to a Command, the Reason of which is undiscoverable; as if the Command was absolutely indifferent. It seems therefore more agreeable to Divine Wisdom and Goodness, to prove the Obedience of his Creatures by such Commands; as have a real, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> secret Tendency to the fore-mentioned Good; than by such as have none at all. And on this Account I apprehend that all positive Precepts have such Tendencies, either perceptible or imperceptible.

<span><sup><span class="snote"></span></sup> Nothing more is meant here by the Perfection of Christ<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Doctrine, than its perfect Agreement with the unprejudiced Apprehensions of Mankind.</span>
</aside>
<strong>Concerning</strong> those Duties, the <em>Tendencies</em> whereof are, or may be, <em>perceived</em>; there seems not to be the least Room for Dispute. Whatever Part of <em>Revealed Religion</em> has a visible Connection with <em>Natural Religion</em>; must stand on the same Foundation. And such are the peculiar Precepts of <em>Christianity</em>; as hath been largely proved by the ablest Hands. Whatever promotes or facilitates the Practice of moral Duties; cannot be unfit for Men to learn; nor, by Consequence, unworthy of a Divine Revelation.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But might not Human Reason find out such Rules itself; and be able to discover <em>Religion of the Means</em>, as well as <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">as [<em>Religion</em>] | <em>Religion</em></span></span> <em>Religion of the End?</em> It had not done it; and perhaps never would. The Management of distempered Minds, like that of distempered Bodies, requires more Skill, than the Direction of those that are sound. In a perfect State of Health, of either Kind; <em>Nature</em> may be a compleat Guide. But in Sickness, and deep Diseases, Nature may be at a Loss; both in respect of Medicines, and a proper Regimen. In this Case, which in Fact was the Case; the <em>Souls</em> of Men want a <em>Physician</em> no less than their <em>Bodies</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But supposing such Rules might and would have been found out by Human <em>Reason</em>; still they must be more valuable, and more effectual, if conveyed by <em>Revelation</em>. The Voice of a <em>Philosopher</em> would neither be heard so far, nor make such Impression; as that of a <em>Prophet</em>, or an <em>Apostle</em>. Men would naturally be more attentive to a Teacher, who could command <em>Winds</em>, <em>Seas</em>, and <em>Storms</em>; than to such as could command nothing but <em>Words:</em> and make a wide Difference between framing Arguments, and Periods; and <em>raising the Dead</em>. There is more Weight, more Authority, in a single Fact of this Kind; than in all the Volumes of the <em>Greek</em> Sages put together. I speak not of <em>convincing</em>, but <em>awakening</em> the Minds of Men; which is what the World chiefly wanted. And even as to <em>Conviction</em>; as Matters were thereby brought into a much narrower Compass; so they were made more level to all Capacities. Instead of long Trains of Reasoning, and intricate Deductions; <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Deductions; [thus] | thus</span></span> thus the Evidence stood. He who can raise the Dead, must have God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority: and He who has God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Authority, can bring nothing but Truth; and even Truths of the highest Importance. And when to this are added, the Reasonableness, and<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> Perfection of Christ<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Doctrine; who, in all respects, taught as never Man taught; what Satisfaction, what Conviction, could be afforded Mankind, either shorter or surer?

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to return: However manifest the Connection may be between <em>Revealed</em> and <em>Natural</em> Religion, in respect of the Rules and Precepts above mentioned; yet what shall we say to Those, which have <em>no visible Tendencies</em>, either natural or moral? I answer, that they are, and must be, equally secure; unless we make Human Reason the Measure and Standard of all Truth. To affirm that all Precepts are Incumbrances on Religion; whereof Men cannot discover the Grounds, and Connection with it; is not to be accounted for on any other Supposition. For if all the Reasons of Things are confessedly not known, nor knowable by them; then, possibly, some of the unknown Reasons may be the Foundation of certain <em>positive Precepts</em>; which, for ought they know, may be very useful, and subservient to Religion.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But, perhaps, it may be urged; That supposing such Precepts thus <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">thus [grounded;] | grounded;</span></span> grounded; yet how can they produce any Effect <em>morally</em> good, or conduce to the Improvement of the Agent; while he neither knows the Reason of them, nor sees their Connection with Morality? Can they operate as Charms? Or produce moral Effects imperceptibly?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I answer, that however the <em>Precepts</em> may operate, or not operate; yet Mens <em>Obedience</em> thereto, (supposing <em>them</em> divine, and <em>it</em> sincere) must have a good Effect; even sensibly, on the Mind of the Agents. Whatever be the Matter of the Command; every Act of pure Obedience manifestly conduces to the Furtherance of Piety and Godliness. And that not only in <em>them</em>, but in <em>others</em> too. Such Acts are not only of private, but publick Use; not only self-beneficial, but exemplary.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;On these Accounts, it may be very fitting, in certain Cases, for God to require, and Man to pay, an implicit Obedience. <em>Reason</em> itself commits Men into the Hands of <em>Religion</em>; for the Improvement of their Dispositions, and the Benefit of Discipline. They ought not only to submit their Minds, and conform their Actions, to the universal Law of Reason and Truth; but likewise, or rather as an Instance thereof, to pay a personal Homage to that great and glorious Being, whose Attribute Truth is. More particularly to entertain of Him the justest and most honourable Conceptions, that they can possibly frame; and to acknowledge Him most wise and righteous in all his Ways. In order hereto, the <em>positive</em> Part of Religion <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Religion [seems] | seems</span></span> seems highly expedient; that his Authority may be revered, and submitted to; not only when the Reasons of his Commands are discernable, but when they are not; not only when they speak their own Worth, but when they are silent. In a Word; that the Divine Perfections may be confessed, and adored, even when <em>Clouds and Darkness are round about them</em>; as well as when they appear in a clear Light, or break out into an open Blaze of Wisdom and Truth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Nor is this more for the Honour of God, than it is for the Benefit of his Worshippers; as might be shewn at large.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>But</strong> to illustrate and confirm the Point before us; I beg Leave to ask, whether it would be an Impeachment of any Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Wisdom; if, to try the Obedience of his Children, he should give them an Order, the Reason of which none of them were able to discover? I would ask again, supposing any of them disobeyed it, merely on that Account no good Reason occurring against it; whether he would not look upon it as a just Cause of Displeasure? It must be allowed, that the wisest Parent in the World would be dissatisfied at such Conduct in his Children, and resent it accordingly.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But concerning the former Question, it may perhaps be urged, that the Instance is wide of the Case in Hand: forasmuch as an omniscient Creator can have no Occasion to try his Creatures, whatever Oc<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Oc- [casion] | casion</span></span>casion Parents may have to try their Children, The Answer is as follows.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Intention, in the Trial of his Creatures was merely to inform himself concerning the Behaviour of his Creatures; then indeed such Experiments might be altogether needless. But the Ends and Reasons of his trying them, are, I humbly presume, quite of another Nature. Tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> He sees how his Creatures <em>will</em> act, from first to last; and even how they <em>would</em> act on every Supposition; yet till their Obedience be actually exercised, and proved; neither can they reap the Benefit of it, nor He the Glory. The natural Advantages of Virtue and Religion are not to be obtained without an actual Exertion of Mens Wills and Endeavours; as not resulting from what <em>may</em>, or <em>might</em> be done; but what really <em>is</em> done. In like manner, the Reverence due to God and Goodness must be made manifest. Good Works must not only be <em>done</em>, but <em>seen</em>; that God may be glorified in the Prevalence of Truth and Righteousness. Neither of the Ends here mentioned can be effectually accomplished, unless Mens good Intentions and Dispositions be reduced to Practice.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And forasmuch as <em>positive Precepts</em> afford peculiar Opportunities of Trial, and exercise even the Moral Dispositions of the Mind in such a Way as could not otherwise be done; more particularly Gratitude, Piety, and Submission to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Will; no other Cause need be assigned for the Institution of them. Their <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Their [Con-] | Connexion</span></span> Connexion with Truth and Rectitude is fully manifest; and whoever attempts to separate them from Natural Religion, wounds, and weakens it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;There may indeed be Difficulty in accounting for a Multiplicity of such Precepts; and even a few may be perverted and abused. As to the latter of these Cases, it needs no clearing; and whenever the former is Fact, it must be owing to a Concurrence of extraordinary Circumstances: one of which must, I think, be, an unusual Grossness of Mind, and Hardness of Heart, in the People concerned; rendering them, in some measure incapable of purer Laws, and more moral Duties.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But whatever may be said of such Precepts, when very <em>numerous</em>; and of their Interference with Morality; no Argument can be drawn from hence against the Appointment of any. On the contrary, we have seen that the Reason of the Thing weighs the other Way; and renders their Institution probable, without further Evidence. And if it appear they are enjoined; that they ought to be observed, is surely a Point that needs no Proof. Men can never acquit themselves even of their Obligations to <em>Truth</em>; if they do not act according to the <em>Relation</em> between <em>God</em> and <em>Them:</em> which certainly they can never do, if they disobey or neglect any of his known Commands, without a moral Dispensation. This Case excepted, every Divine Injunction must bind to Obedience; whether the Tendency of it appear, or not. And however in<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">in- [con-] | considerable</span></span>considerable the Action may be in itself; yet since it is wrought on a <em>Moral Ground</em>; from hence it must derive both Value and Beauty. In neither respect, it must be owned, comparable to the Performance of a <em>Moral Duty</em>; which, having the same <em>Ground</em>, is moreover essentially amiable and good in itself. <em>Moral</em> Virtues <em>religiously</em> practised, may be compared, in the Words of a Royal Author, to <em>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Could</strong> it be proved, that <em>Reason</em> and <em>Truth</em> were not binding in their own Nature; but that all Obligation is to be referred to <em>Religion</em>, and resolved entirely into the Divine <em>Will</em>; then indeed the Competition (if it may be called such) between <em>Moral</em> and <em>Positive Duties</em> might easily and speedily be adjusted. It would be evident that the Pre-eminence could belong to neither; but that they were, and must be, precisely equal. If there be no Obligation, I say, but what arises from the <em>Will</em> of God; and supposing all his Commands alike clear and express, and equally practicable; it is manifest there could be no Ground of Preference among them. Both the Obligation and the Dignity of every Duty would be exactly the same.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But, on the other hand, if <em>Truth</em> be obligatory in itself, and God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Will</em> only obliges in virtue of Truth; then the Matter cannot possibly be thus compromised. <em>Moral</em> and <em>Positive Duties</em> will thus admit of no Comparison. For there must be very different Degrees of <em>Im</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Im</em>- [<em>portance</em>,] | <em>portance</em>,</span></span><em>portance</em>, as well as <em>Evidence</em>. We certainly know that some Duties are both <em>morally</em> and <em>naturally</em> good in themselves; both directly conducive to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Glory; and perfective of Human Nature: and from hence are <em>absolutely assured</em>, that they must not only be agreeable to the <em>Will</em> of God; but likewise in full Proportion to their Moment: and in the same Proportion must they <em>intrinsically oblige</em>, on the same account. Other Duties are, at most, only <em>indirectly</em>, <em>instrumentally</em>, or <em>consequentially</em> good; and at the same Time the Evidence of their being required not equal to the former. For, without immediate Revelation, no higher Proof than <em>Probability</em> is to be had concerning any <em>Positive</em> Duties. So that in neither respect can they rival <em>Moral</em> ones. In short; if the <em>Obligations of Truth and Reason</em> be any Thing; if they be but real, and not imaginary; they must not only be superior, but supreme, with all moral Agents.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If it be insisted, that all <em>religious Obedience</em> is founded on <em>Reason</em> and <em>moral Truth</em>; this has already been granted, and, if I mistake not, proved. But what follows? Will any Man say, that because a <em>Pebble</em> may be <em>set in Gold</em> as well as a <em>Diamond</em>; therefore their Value is equal? <em>Positive Precepts</em>, however useful in Fact; yet might have been quite useless, and altogether <em>indifferent</em>: and yet even then they would have had a <em>moral Ground</em>. This is common to all real Duties: but no way affects or alters their <em>intrinsick</em> Worth.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Let [us] | us</span></span> us view this Matter in another Light. <em>Moral</em> Duties, when <em>religiously</em> performed, are Acts of Obedience as well as <em>positive</em> Duties. And it is not to be doubted but good Men frequently join God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Authority</em> and the Obligations of <em>Truth</em> together; and act with regard to both. Thus compared, the Difference will be equally manifest. The Rectitude of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Will</em> is acknowledged either way. But in moral Performances, Homage is not only paid to the Rectitude of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Will</em>; but to the Sacredness and Perfection of his <em>Understanding</em>, from whence all eternal Truths, necessarily flow. To which may be added; that if God wills Things in Proportion to real Worth, and intrinsick Goodness; then moral Duties must be proportionably more conformable to his Will, than any other. And on this account <em>Morality</em> may be looked upon not only as essential; but as the most <em>religious</em> Part; even of <em>Religion</em> itself.

<strong>Before</strong> I shut up these Papers, I beg Leave to answer an Objection or two, which may seem to lie against the principal Doctrine contained in them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>It</strong> may be urged then, in the first Place, that if so great Things be ascribed to <em>Reason</em> considered <em>objectively</em>, or as the <em>Rule of Truth</em>; the Consequence will be too much in Favour of our <em>Faculty</em>, which thereby seems immoderately magnified. It is on all hands confessed, that no Law can oblige any moral Agents further than it is <em>known</em>. If then <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">then [<em>Truth</em>] | <em>Truth</em></span></span> <em>Truth</em> be of universal Obligation, it must be universally known; and all <em>Relations</em> be visible and plain to every Human Understanding.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;This is just as if a Man should argue, that because the Light of the Sun universally directs the Sight, and charms the Sense; therefore every human Eye must take it all in, and comprehend its Diffusion through the whole System. <em>Moral Obligation</em> has been here considered as <em>intellectual Attraction</em>, of the noblest Kind. But it is not, like <em>corporeal Attraction</em>, effected at a Distance. <em>Reason</em>, or the Appearance of Reason, must be perceived, before it can move the Mind at all.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Between our <em>Faculty</em>, and <em>Truth</em> in general, there is an infinite Disproportion. Between our Faculty, and the whole System of <em>moral Truth</em>, a very great one. And even that Part of it which concerns ourselves, so far as to be requisite for bringing our Minds to that Pitch of Improvement and Perfection whereof they are capable; even that, I say, seems to me a larger Portion than Man<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Reason alone has been able to gather up.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However justly the <em>Sufficiency of Human Reason</em> may be maintained in Opposition to <em>monopolizing Christians</em>; yet no Occasion, nor Grounds can I find, for stretching it to the Lengths and Demands of <em>Deism</em>. For my part, I am fully convinced, even in this Respect, of the Usefulness, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> not the Necessity of Revelation; and of the Advancement of <em>moral Science</em> thereby introduced. If Mens <em>Practice</em> be not <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">not [improved] | improved</span></span> improved by it in the same Proportion; I need not say where the Blame lies.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But to return to the Objection; <em>Human Reason</em> is neither magnified, nor diminished, by the Obligation and Perfection of <em>moral Truth</em>. For no Obligation, whether <em>moral</em>, or <em>sensible</em>, can possibly commence before Perception. This Doctrine therefore plainly leaves Mens Faculties just as it found them.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Again</strong>; if <em>Truth</em> only oblige <em>as such</em>, and when it is perceived; what shall we say to <em>Errors</em> and <em>Misperceptions?</em> How comes it to pass that <em>Erroneous</em> Consciences are as fast bound as those that are <em>best-informed?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I answer, that this Obligation belongs not to <em>Error</em>, but <em>Truth</em>. <em>Error</em> in itself can oblige nothing, and is nothing, but a mere imaginary Relation. And yet so sacred is <em>Truth</em>, that it binds and attaches Men to its very <em>Semblance</em>. Even a false Copy shall be regarded and revered, where the Original is not to be had. In plain Words, that the <em>Will</em> be governed by the <em>Understanding</em>, whatever its Powers and Perceptions may be; is an eternal Dictate of Reason and Truth. <em>This Relation</em> is plain and clear in the midst of the greatest Obscurities; and to this the Mind conforms and submits even in the Pursuit of Error.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Lastly</strong>, It may perhaps be objected, that the Doctrine here maintained seems to give an Advantage to <em>Unbelievers</em>; who are too much addicted to such Doctrines already, and prone to make an ill Use of them.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;My An<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">An- [swer] | swer</span></span>swer is, that I grudge no Part of Mankind the Benefit of Truth. If they pervert, or misapply it; let Them bear the Blame. As the Abuse of Revelation is no Argument against Revelation; so neither is the Abuse of Reason any Argument against Reason. But indeed in the Case before us, I can see no Advantage likely to accrue to them from any such Doctrine; unless it be that of their Conviction: which if ever it be effected by Reasoning; the Arguments, I am persuaded, must be drawn out of this Quiver. For while they imagine a Disagreement between Reason and Revelation; all Attempts in behalf of the latter must be in vain.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If we go along with the <em>Deists</em> as far as we can, in the Paths of <em>Morality</em> and <em>Natural Religion</em>; we need not doubt bringing them at last into the Road of <em>Revelation</em>. But if we divide at first setting out, and take quite different Ways; the Consequence will probably be, that we shall wander on without ever meeting, and perhaps leave Truth between us.&mdash;&mdash;To depart from established Principles, and fundamental Truths, because Unbelievers adhere to them, and pervert them; seems to me a most unaccountable Conduct. If they disclaim the <em>Authority of Revelation</em>; must we therefore renounce the <em>Obligations of Reason?</em> If they rashly forsake the <em>Gospel-Rule</em>, and the <em>Laws of Christianity</em>; must we as rashly give up the <em>Rule of Rectitude</em>, and the <em>Law of Truth?</em> Hence, if I mistake not, chiefly proceed their Advantages and Triumphs. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Triumphs. [Whereas,] | Whereas,</span></span> Whereas, were the Fortifications of Revealed Religion entirely erected on the forementioned Ground; it might easily and effectually be defended? or rather the Siege would soon be raised.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;However; <em>Christianity</em> pure and undefiled can never be in any Danger. <em>True Reason</em> must claim Kindred and common Parentage with it; and therefore run gladly into its Embraces. And <em>false Reason</em> cannot possibly prevail against it; but must sooner or later fly before it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In fine; <em>Revelation</em> and <em>Rectitude</em>, however Men may confront them, or however disguise them; are, in themselves, at perfect Unity. Let them but appear in their native Colours; and such a Congruity, such an Affinity will be found between them; that whoever receives the One, will not long be able to reject the Other.

<div class="indented numbered">
HAVING perused, since the collecting of these Tracts, a <em>Discourse</em> lately published, entitled, <em>Wisdom the first Spring of Action in the Deity</em>, the Subject and Drift of which are either the same, or nearly allied to what the Reader has met with in the foregoing Papers; I beg Leave to shut up this Volume with a few Observations concerning some Passages and Propositions contained in it.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>This</strong> <em>Discourse</em>, however judicious in the Main; however abounding in solid Remarks, and sound Reasonings; and setting many Things in a very clear and strong Light; yet seems to me to leave a most material Point in great Uncertainty and Obscurity.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;There needs no Apology, to an Author of his Ability and Candor, for the following Expostulation. I am well assured he will <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">will [object] | object</span></span> object nothing to the <em>Manner</em>, whatever he may do to the <em>Matter</em> of it. Perhaps I have mistaken <em>his</em> Meaning; or perhaps <em>my own</em> wants to be rectified. In either Case I shall not think a few Pages misemploy<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d: for as his Meaning appears well worth a particular Search; so if there be any Error lying at my Door, I care not how soon I get it remov<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>d. I have already given him Proof, in a Marginal Note, that I am not disposed to resist Evidence, or struggle against Conviction.

<strong>As</strong> I apprehend, the Author has justly rejected, and indeed fairly disproved, all <em>In-[!!!] Inclinations</em> in the Deity analogous to Human Instincts; placing the <em>first Spring of Action</em> in <em>intellectual</em> Perception. And the one seems a plain Consequence of the other; for all Excitements to Action must, I presume, arise either from <em>Inclination</em>, or <em>Reason</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I would further observe, That whoever maintains the Reality of Intellectual Springs, and Rational Motives, might be expected in Course to allow them the Pre-eminence. For if Reason excite at all, it cannot, I think, fail to do it in respect of an Agent perfectly rational, with peculiar Force, and principal Influence. And, indeed, the Author, on some Occasions, seems to favour this Conclusion as much as my Self.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Nevertheless, I am not able to discover how this Matter appears to him upon the Whole; and what it is that he looks upon as the chief End, and supreme <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">supreme [Inten-] | Intention</span></span> Intention of a Moral Agent: more particularly, whether the Maintenance of <em>Right</em> and <em>Truth</em>, which may be called <em>Moral Good</em>; or the Production of <em>Happiness</em>, which is <em>Natural Good</em>.

<strong>He</strong> lays<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> it down as most evident, that <em>the essential Fitnesses of Things and Actions being perfectly known to God, are the true and invariable Reasons of his Conduct</em>. And<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> elsewhere he represents the Deity as <em>acting without any other Reason or Motive, than the intrinsick Beauty and Goodness of the Action</em>. From whence may be concluded not only his Attachment to the <em>intellectual Principle</em>, and <em>moral Intention</em>; but also an Acknowledgment of the fore-mentioned <em>Supremacy</em>. And, indeed, the whole Tenour of his Book, and even the very Title, look very much in Favour of such a Supposition.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;On the other hand, he appears in several Places, if I understand him, ultimately to resolve these <em>Moral Fitnesses</em> into the Production of <em>Natural Good</em>; to consider them as merely relative and ministerial to <em>Happiness</em>, and derive their whole Worth from this very Consideration. Thus, for Instance, speaking of <em>Beauty</em> and <em>Order</em>, <em>moral</em> as well as <em>natural</em>; <em>Were it supposeable</em>,[sic] says he,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>that they had no more Aptitude to give Pleasure, than Deformity and Confusion, there would be nothing to chuse between them</em>. Again;<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>Abstracted from the Connexion it hath with</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>with</em> [<em>Happi</em>-] | <em>Happiness</em>,</span></span> <em>Happiness, nothing in the World is of the least Value</em>: having just before pointed it out as <em>the remote Foundation of all moral Fitness</em>. And agreeably hereto, he speaks<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> of <em>the Fitness of Punishment</em>; which, instead of measuring by the Rule of <em>Truth</em>, and the Right of the Case, he deduces from a Regard to <em>Happiness</em>, and affirms it is <em>not to be explained in any other Way</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Between these contrary Appearances, and seemingly opposite Declarations, I stick fast; uncertain what to conclude, or how to determine. He seems sometimes to divide the Sovereignty between <em>Rectitude</em> and <em>Happiness</em>; and at other times, to resign it to <em>Rectitude</em> with one Hand, and resume it with the other. Let me therefore be excused if I throw together, at a Venture, the following Observations. Should he prove to be really unconcerned in them, yet others are not; and therefore, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> less pertinent, they may not be quite useless.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Those</strong> <em>Ends</em> about which <em>Wisdom</em> is said to be <em>primarily conversant</em>, must either be equal in Value or Dignity, or unequal: if equal; there can be no Room or Occasion for <em>Wisdom</em> to direct the Agent in his Choice: if unequal; there must be a Pre-eminence, and a Primacy. I ask then, what is the primary End or Aim of a moral Agent? The <em>Glory of God</em>; or the <em>Benefit of his Creatures?</em> In other Words, the Maintenance of <em>Right and</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>and</em> [<em>Truth</em>;] | <em>Truth</em>;</span></span> <em>Truth</em>; or the Advancement of <em>Happiness?</em> If any Man can prove that these Ends are perpetually and universally coincident; the Inquiry will either become needless, or less important. But <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>till this be done, it seems to he a Point of very great Moment.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Supposing then an Interference; what is to be concluded, or determined? If <em>Natural Good</em> be pronounced Supreme; Difficulties will, I doubt, arise, innumerable and unsurmountable. Puzling [sic] Cases and Perplexing Suppositions will start up on every side; demanding to be answered, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> it be morally impossible they should ever come into Fact. I might refer the Reader to a preceding Note; hut let us attend to the Author before us.

<em>PUT the Case</em>, says he,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> <em>that a great Number might be made happy, by placing a Single Being, as soon as he existed, in a State of Misery; would this justify such Treatment of an innocent Being?</em> He answers, <em>Surely, No</em>. But why not? If <em>Happiness</em> be the chief and ultimate End of Action, every Thing must give Way to it; and a lesser Quantity be always resigned for the sake of a greater. However such a Sacrifice might be grudged by the suffering Individual; yet, on this Supposition, he ought to submit; and whether he submitted or no, be compelled to suffer. Whatever Degree of Misery he endured; supposing it productive of equal or greater <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">greater [Degrees] | Degrees</span></span> Degrees of Happiness to the Publick; this Principle would bind him down, and effectually bar all Relief. What would it avail to plead his <em>Innocence</em>, or the Hardship of his Case? or to urge the Violation of <em>Right</em> and <em>Truth?</em> Can these have any Weight, or be at all regarded, where they stand in the Way of Happiness, and obstruct a general Interest? Not certainly, if <em>moral</em> Good be inferior and subordinate to <em>natural</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But if the Reverse be allowed; then it will follow, that the least <em>moral Evil</em> must not be submitted to, in order to obtain the greatest <em>natural Good</em>; nor one unrighteous Action done, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> the Consequence be supposed beneficial to a whole System of Creatures.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Fitness</em> therefore entirely depends on the Resolution of the foregoing Question; forasmuch as, in numberless Cases, it can never be known what is <em>fit</em> to be ordained, unless that be previously determined. If <em>Truth</em> be the ruling Principle, one <em>Course</em> must be followed; if <em>Happiness</em>, another; not only very different, but, perhaps, quite contrary. So that the Case here put, and many others, can admit of no Decision, <span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>till that leading Point be first fixed.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;How far the Author meant to fix it in the following Proposition, I cannot well determine. He expresly [sic] declares,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> that <em>the first View of the Deity is universal Good</em>. If we are to understand by <em>universal Good</em>, the <em>Happiness</em> <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Happiness</em> [of] | of</span></span> of the <em>Universe</em>, or the Well-being of all his Creatures, thus I argue; Either this View is proposed in Conformity to <em>Truth</em> and <em>Fitness</em>, or it is not: if it be not; then the Scheme of <em>Benevolence</em> takes Place: if it be; then it cannot be the <em>first View</em>. In this Case <em>Rectitude</em> must be the <em>first View</em>, and the Production of <em>Happiness</em> subordinate.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;But, indeed, as to this Matter, the Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Meaning is so ambiguous, and his Opinion so uncertain; some Expressions looking and leaning one way, and some another; that I ought to be cautious what I ascribe to him. I own, and have formerly taken notice, that the two Goods, <em>Moral</em> and <em>Natural</em>, are wonderfully linked together, and interwoven: but however they may be connected, they should not be confounded. They are distinct Objects, and distinct Ends; and one of them must precede, and predominate universally.

<strong>Does</strong> then the Author aknowledge [!!!] the Supremacy of Truth and <em>Fitness</em>, and contend nevertheless that, in Conformity thereto, universal Good, and unlimited Happiness, must be proposed, and produced? This cannot be. He grants,<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> in one Case at least, that <em>Happiness</em> is actually limited by <em>Fitness</em>. And since he owns one Limitation; he cannot well deny but there <em>may</em> be many more. And, indeed, the <em>Ph&aelig;nomena</em> we meet with, both in the Natural and Moral World, give <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">give [but] | but</span></span> but too much Countenance to such a Supposition.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Let this Conclusion then be laid down, and mutually agreed on; That as much Happiness is produced, as Truth and Fitness will admit. But let no Man invert this Conclusion, and say, That as much Regard is to be shewn to Truth and Fitness, as can consist with publick Happiness. This would be degrading the former, and erecting a benevolent Scheme at the Expence of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Glory.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>That</strong> this is not the Author<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Intention, whatever Passages may look this Way, may reasonably be presumed from the fore-mentioned Concession. For if he really supposed <em>Happiness</em> the primary View, the supreme End of Action; how could he acknowledge it to admit of any <em>Limitation?</em> How should <em>Wisdom</em> set any Bounds at all to the Production of a Good, or the Accomplishment of a Design, which is paramount to all Views, Aims, and Considerations whatever? On this Supposition, Wisdom must unavoidably direct to an unbounded Communication of Happiness; and whatever Omnipotence can effect, must, upon the Whole, be produced quite through the Universe, to the utmost Extent of Possibility.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>On</strong> the other hand, if the Author had no Design of opposing the Pre-eminence, or diminishing the Dignity of <em>Truth</em> and <em>Rectitude</em>; what shall we say to the Assertions above cited? particularly to this, that <em>ab</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>ab</em>- [<em>stracted</em>] | <em>stracted</em></span></span><em>stracted from its Connexion with Happiness, nothing in the World is of the least Value. And again; Nothing whatsoever is of Value, but Happiness,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;or that which has some Relation to Happiness</em>. It cannot be improper to ask, what we are to understand here by <em>Value?</em> If it has no Meaning but what is relative to <em>Happiness</em>, the Propositions are identical. But then I would gladly be informed, whether a Thing may not be worthy of high Regard, Esteem, and Reverence, on other Accounts than its conducing or relating to Happiness. Is there no such Thing as <em>Moral Good</em>, strictly so called? Is not <em>Truth</em> sacred in its own Mature? Would no Homage or Submission be due to it, unless it was subservient to Profit? Can it be said, There is no Worth in Virtue, but what results from its Beneficialness and Delightfulness? No Value in Piety, or Gratitude, but what arises from a Tendency to Joy, or <em>an Aptitude to give Pleasure?</em>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Virtue is not Happiness, tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> naturally productive of the greatest: neither is Happiness the End or Aim of a Moral Agent, considered as such. The sole Object of the Understanding is Truth; in which we must acquiesce, whether it be advantageous, or detrimental; grateful, or grievous.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<em>Rectitude</em> is so far from owing its whole Value to its Connexion with <em>Happiness</em>; that this is the least and lowest Praise belonging to it. It is so far from attracting Esteem solely on this Account; that the truest and sublimest <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">sublimest [Pleasure] | Pleasure</span></span> Pleasure arises from not aiming at Pleasure, but levelling at a nobler Mark. Such is the Sacredness and Majesty of Truth and Virtue, that tho<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span> every pure Pleasure be taken into their Retinue, they will by no means admit it to a Partnership in the Throne; and when ever it sits there, it sits as an Usurper.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;To honour and serve God with all our Strength, leads, without Question, directly to Happiness: but supposing the contrary, would it become a worthless Performance? So far from it, that its Value ever rises in Proportion to its Disinterestedness. The highest Excellence of such a Duty consists in that <em>Abstraction from Happiness</em>, which, according to the foregoing Proposition, not only reduces, but annihilates its Value.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> the only Difference, whether in the Natural or Moral World, between <em>Beauty</em> and <em>Deformity,</em> Order <em>and</em> Confusion, be an <em>Aptitude to give Pleasure</em>; what is called <em>Moral Good</em>, must be a mere <em>Chim&aelig;ra</em>; and the firmest Bonds of Truth, imaginary Obligations. But such an <em>Aptitude</em> is only an inferior and secondary Consideration. What chiefly recommends Rectitude is a Good of a superior Kind, and more exalted Nature. The Mind pursues and embraces it, not because it is <em>pleasurable</em>, but because it is <em>fit</em>. It is in vain to alledge, what Fruits Virtue yields, and what Enjoyment it produces. The same may be said, in some measure, of Speculative Truth. Yet, properly speaking, <em>Pleasure</em> is no more <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">more [the] | the</span></span> the Aim and Object of <em>Science</em>, than it is of <em>Virtue</em>.

<em>WHY does God favour the Righteous more than the Wicked? Why is He faithful to his Promises?</em> Are Questions put by the Author, who had furnished us with this Answer<sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup> beforehand: They <em>are fit to be done</em>; <em>therefore God does them</em>; moved by <em>the intrinsick Beauty and Fitness of the Actions</em>. It is not said, that God does them in order to <em>benefit</em> his Creatures; much less with any View of <em>private Advantage</em>; but precisely because they are <em>fit</em>; essentially and unalterably <em>fit</em>. Again; <em>Pleasure</em><sup><span class="tnote"></span></sup><em> is not properly the Cause of God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s acting wisely; because the very Ground of that Pleasure which accompanies the Divine Actions, is His acting in the Manner He does, or according to the Reason and Nature of Things, as the constant Motive of his Actions</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;From hence then I conclude, and think the Author should join with me, that there must be another <em>Good</em>, a real Good, besides <em>Happiness</em>, and distinct from <em>Pleasure</em>; otherwise God would be influenced by a worthless Object, and excited to act by a Motive of <em>no Weight or Value</em>. Whether the Motive weigh any Thing, or Nothing, let the Author consider; it is, by his own Confession, <em>abstracted from</em> all <em>Connexion with Happiness</em>, or Pleasure, in the Agent<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Regard; such Abstraction being acknowledged the very <em>Ground</em> of that subse<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">subse- [quent] | quent</span></span>quent <em>Pleasure</em> which results from <em>acting wisely</em>.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;I conclude further, that there must not only be a Good distinct from <em>Pleasure</em>, but superior to it; otherwise Reason and <em>Rectitude</em> could not be God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s first and supreme, much less his sole Motive; as is here allowed.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Again; if <em>Moral Fitness</em> happens, in any Case, to interfere with the <em>Natural Good</em> of the Rational System; it follows, for the same Reason, that still it must take Place, and be complied with.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;And lastly, since this Good has no Dependence either on the Creator<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s Interest, or his Creatures; the Inference is plain, that it must be, not a relative, but an absolute and essential Good; and therefore, in the highest Degree, sacred and inviolable.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;If these Conclusions are just, how can it be said, or supposed, that the Worth of every Thing depends on its <em>Connexion with Happiness?</em> The Supreme Agent is confessed to <em>abstract from this</em> in his whole Conduct; and invariably to chuse and pursue <em>Moral Fitness</em>, not because it is <em>beatifick</em>, but because it is <em>right</em>. The Result is, that here is an Object, if not <em>unconnected with Happiness</em>, yet <em>abstracted from</em> it; which is so far from serving only to <em>weigh against Nothing</em>, that it out weighs <em>every Thing</em>; so far from being of <em>no Value</em>, that it stands <em>Supreme</em> in the Divine Estimation, and is altogether <em>inestimable</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>That</strong> the Deity would ever counteract Truth and <em>Fitness</em>, either in Favour of his Creatures, or on any other Account; is a Sup<span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Sup- [position] | position</span></span>position which the Author will by no means admit. How then can he entertain so low an Idea of it, as to derive all its Moment, and Significance, from its Relation to <em>Happiness?</em> This Fitness sometimes consists in the Abridgment and Limitation of Happiness: and supposing it had no other Effect, or Tendency, in any particular Instance; would the Author maintain it to be a Thing of no Account? If he should; the Consequences, as I have already shewn, are neither to be avoided, nor endured. In short, whether <em>Fitness</em> produce <em>Happiness</em>, or limit it; confer it, or with-hold it; since it is the first Aim, and immutable Rule, and supreme Motive, of the Deity; it must have a <em>Worth</em>, whatever Name be given it, quite independent of all <em>Natural Good</em>, and vastly superior to it. Certainly that can never be reputed a Matter of small Moment; which eternally directs and governs an All-perfect Agent; and is the Main Spring that moves and actuates all the Wheels of Creation and Providence.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Upon</strong> the Whole; the Author has, on firm Grounds, represented the Actions of the Deity as immutably conducted by his <em>Wisdom</em>, and his Wisdom by <em>Fitness</em>; but, to our Concern and Disappointment, here he has stopped, and left us to take the next Step in the Dark. He has not thought fit to say, wherein this <em>Fitness</em> consists, or on what Foundation it stands: and yet without this, I see not how the Inquiry can terminate to our Satisfaction. <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">Satisfaction. [Certainly] | Certainly</span></span> Certainly it is of great Importance to know, what it is that constitutes Actions <em>fit</em>, and whereon that <em>Fitness</em> ultimately depends: whether on <em>Truth</em>, or <em>Sensibility</em>; on the intrinsick Reasons and Relations of Things, or their Tendencies to promote Natural Good.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;While this remains undetermined, the Mind fluctuates, and knows not where to fix. Not only its Knowledge is defective; but likewise its Practice unsettled. For how would we rightly imitate the Moral Perfection of the Deity, till it be known, whether of these Principles be chiefly regarded by Him? If a Competition arises between the Dictates of <em>Truth</em> and <em>Equity</em>, and the Demands of Publick <em>Interest</em>, of any Kind; how shall it be adjusted by the Rule of <em>Fitness</em>, till the Point I am speaking of be decided? In short, the Dignity of Virtue seems in a more especial manner concerned in the Issue of this Inquiry; that it may appear, whether we are to look upon Morality as a real and sacred <em>Science</em>, or only a wise and beneficial <em>Art</em>; as the <em>Law of Truth</em>, or only a <em>System of Politicks</em>.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>If</strong> every Thing be finally resolved into <em>Natural Good</em>, still Virtue will indeed be an useful Rule; a profitable Expedient; but what more? What will become of that Authority and Majesty, that Sacredness and Divineness, which have been ever ascribed to it, not only by Philosophers and Moralists, but by Prophets and Apostles? Why have the former so carefully and constantly separated <em>Ho</em><span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds"><em>Ho</em>- [<em>nesty</em>] | <em>nesty</em></span></span><em>nesty</em> from <em>Utility</em>, <em>Rectitude</em> from <em>Pleasure?</em> Or why have the latter laid so peculiar and perpetual a Stress on the <em>Glory of God</em>, above all other Views, and preferably to all Aims and Intentions whatever?&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;In condemning that Maxim of <em>doing Evil that Good might come</em>, is it to be imagined that nothing more was meant, than forbidding us to sacrifice a <em>greater Interest</em> to a <em>less?</em> And yet if <em>Moral Evil</em>, imply nothing more than a Counteraction to Enjoyment, an Encroachment upon Happiness; this Construction is unavoidable.
</div>

<div class="indented numbered">
<strong>Let</strong> not then Pleasure, or Interest, of any Kind, presume to stand. in Competition with the Dignity of Right Reason, and the Divinity of Truth. For <em>Divine</em> it is, in the strictest Sense; coeternal with the Deity, and as necessary as his own Being. These sacred Ideas for ever shine in His perfect Understanding with inconceivable Lustre, and shed a Glory on every Action directed by them. Here it is that we must search, as far as we are permitted and enabled, for the Source of all Beauty and Majesty, Harmony and Perfection.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;From an uninterrupted <em>Conformity</em> to this glorious Rule, results perfect <em>Blessedness</em>. If it be asked, how it is possible to consider them as distinct; I answer, that how ever they may be united or confounded in our Minds, they are effectually and constantly distinguished by the Deity. In his Intention, <em>Rectitude</em> is ever abstracted from <em>Pleasure</em>, as the Author has acknowledged. The latter is <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">is [not] | not</span></span> not the Aim, or the End, of a perfect Agent; but the certain Consequence of the former; and <em>therefore</em> the Consequence, because not the Aim. Were <em>Bliss</em> the real Motive to God<span class="punct">&rsquo;</span>s <em>Goodness</em>; neither the Goodness, nor the Bliss, could be Divine. The Perfection of Happiness flows from an entirely disinterested Choice of an absolute, essential, self-worthy Good. Such is moral Rectitude: which draws the purest and noblest Pleasures after it; but will suffer none to go before it.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Even among created Agents, to embrace Virtue on any Account but its own, is a Kind of Rejection. At least it is hereby depretiated and dishonoured. And the Reason is, because being Self-eligible and Self-good, it ought to be regarded accordingly. It has a native intrinsick Worth, independent of all other Things. Hence it attracts with unborrowed Charms; ever succeeding and prevailing in Proportion to the Perfection of the Agent.

<strong>If</strong> pleading in behalf of <em>Moral Good</em> be thought to imply a Derogation from <em>Natural Good</em>; I submit to the Imputation, however absurd and ridiculous. I can neither give up the irrelative, absolute Nature of the former; nor think it any Disparagement to the latter to be placed in Subordination thereto. And whoever grants the Existence and Influence of a higher <em>Motive</em> than <em>Pleasure</em>; seems under a Necessity of acknowledging another <em>Good</em>, distinct from it, and superior to it. Thus it appears to me; and how far it may deserve <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">deserve [the] | the</span></span> the Reconsideration of this judicious Author, I pretend not to determine.

<strong>After</strong> all, I am very sensible, as every Man must be, of the general Connection between <em>Fitness</em> and Happiness. For a Being of infinite Power and Perfection to communicate Happiness, plenteously and diffusively, is, in general, unquestionably <em>right</em> and <em>fit</em>. We see it, we feel it, to our great Comfort; and our Hopes extend vastly beyond our Enjoyments. But at the same Time we perceive great Chasms, Interruptions, and Inequalities; and if we neglect our Duty, and violate the Laws of Heaven, have just Cause to apprehend greater. Whence can this arise, but from the Obligations of <em>Truth</em>, and the indispensible Demands of <em>Right Reason?</em> An Authority, to which all Things and Persons must submit, by Choice, or Constraint. I humbly presume it is fast fixed to the Throne of God; and that no Considerations in the Universe will ever be able to shake it.

<strong>I</strong> have already owned my Concurrence with the Author in rejecting the Principle of <em>Inclination</em>, as above explained. I have, on many Occasions, declared against it; and he, I think, has clearly and fully disproved it. But whether he have sufficient Grounds for the Denial of <em>Moral Affection</em> likewise in the Supreme Mind, might perhaps admit of some Dispute: But it would appear needless; and perhaps merely verbal. That <em>Pleasure</em>, <em>Joy</em>, <em>Complacency</em>, with which he supposes the <span class="pagno"><span class="pgwds">the [Deity] | Deity</span></span> Deity to behold the Reasons of Things, and the Rectitude of Actions, seem either to denote <em>Moral Affection</em>; or if there be any Difference, it seems too subtle for human Discernment.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;That amiable Agreement of Ideas, wherein <em>Fitness</em> consists; and that Harmony of Actions correspondent thereto, which constitutes <em>Rectitude</em>; must affect and delight, in Proportion to the Purity and Perfection of the Percipient. An Object self-lovely, and essentially excellent, cannot fail to operate very strongly on every Mind rightly disposed. The Result is, in respect of the Deity, perfect Approbation, and infinite Complacency. And whether this be fitly denominated an Affection, or not; I leave to the Inquiry and Determination of Others.

<strong>To</strong> these Observations many others might be added, if this was a proper Place for them. Much also might be said, and that justly, in Praise of the Work here remarked on. If some Things are demurred to, or doubted of, or even disallowed; how few are they in Comparison of those which every Reader approves and admires? But the Author, whoever he be, stands in no need of my Testimony, or Tribute. He is entitled to much higher Regard; and the Publick, I doubt not, does him Justice.
